## Metrics to Track During Backtesting

### Success Metrics

2. **Functional Equivalence:** % where solution works but differs from human approach
3. **Partial Success:** % where solution addresses some but not all issues
4. **Failure Rate:** % where solution doesn't work or makes things worse

### Efficiency Metrics
1. **Time to Solution:** Compare agent vs human resolution time
2. **Iteration Count:** Number of attempts before successful solution
3. **Code Quality:** Lines changed, complexity introduced, style consistency
4. **Test Coverage:** Whether agent adds/maintains tests

### Pattern Recognition Metrics
1. **Pattern Match Accuracy:** How well agent identifies problem patterns
2. **Tool Selection:** Whether agent chooses appropriate tools/approaches
3. **Context Understanding:** Evidence of understanding broader codebase context
4. **Error Recovery:** Ability to detect and correct own mistakes

## Usage Guidelines

### For Agent Developers
1. Start with **Phase 1 cases** to validate basic functionality
2. Use **Phase 2 cases** to identify capability gaps
3. Track metrics on **all 35 cases** for comprehensive evaluation
4. Focus improvement on patterns where failure rate is high

### For Benchmarking
1. Run agents on **randomized subset** (10-15 cases) from different complexity levels
2. Measure against **human baseline** (time, solution quality)
3. Compare **multiple agents** on same test set
4. Track improvement over time with **consistent test set**

### For Training
1. Use **failed cases** to improve agent prompts/tools
2. Extract **successful patterns** from high-success-rate cases
3. Build **synthetic variations** of difficult cases for targeted practice
4. Create **progressive difficulty tracks** for incremental learning

## Next Steps

1. **Validate Dataset**: Run initial backtesting with current agents
2. **Expand Coverage**: Add more test cases for underrepresented patterns
3. **Create Synthetic Cases**: Generate variations for training
4. **Build Evaluation Framework**: Automate scoring and comparison
5. **Establish Baselines**: Record human performance metrics for comparison
