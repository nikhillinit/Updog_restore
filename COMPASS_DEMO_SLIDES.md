# COMPASS Valuation Sandbox - Demo Slides

**Purpose**: Support demo with visual materials for COMPASS backend capabilities
**Audience**: Internal stakeholders
**Duration**: 5-6 minutes of demo time

---

## SLIDE 1: Title

```
COMPASS
Internal Valuation Sandbox

Real-time Portfolio Valuation Intelligence
```

**Talking Point**:
> "COMPASS is our internal valuation engine - think of it as having a dedicated analyst running comparable company analysis for every portfolio company, updated in real-time."

---

## SLIDE 2: The Problem We're Solving

```
Current State Pain Points:
❌ Manual comparable company searches
❌ Stale valuation data (quarterly at best)
❌ Inconsistent methodologies across team
❌ Hours of Excel work for each valuation
❌ No audit trail or scenario comparison

What GPs Need:
✅ Instant valuation updates
✅ Consistent, defensible methodology
✅ Quick "what-if" scenario testing
✅ Data-driven board conversations
✅ LP reporting confidence
```

**Talking Point**:
> "Right now, when a partner asks 'what's Company X worth today?', it takes hours of manual work. With COMPASS, it takes seconds."

Key Components:
• Multi-step valuation calculator
• Comparable company database
• Scenario management & versioning
• Real-time calculations (< 1 second)
```

**Talking Point**:
> "The backend is production-ready. We've built a complete REST API with 9 endpoints covering every valuation workflow."

---

## SLIDE 4: Valuation Methodology

```
COMPASS 4-Step Valuation Process:

1. SELECT COMPARABLES
   → Industry sector filtering
   → Stage/maturity matching
   → Geography consideration

2. CALCULATE MEDIAN MULTIPLE
   → Revenue multiple (default)
   → EBITDA multiple (optional)
   → Statistical outlier removal

3. APPLY ADJUSTMENTS
   → Growth rate premium/discount
   → Market position modifier
   → Risk factor adjustments

4. GENERATE VALUATION
   → Fair value estimate
   → Confidence ranges
   → Comparison to last round
```

**Talking Point**:
> "This follows industry-standard comparable company methodology - the same approach investment banks use, but automated and accessible."

---
