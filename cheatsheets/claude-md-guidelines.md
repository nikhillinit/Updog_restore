# CLAUDE.md Guidelines - Preventing Noise

## What BELONGS in CLAUDE.md
✅ **High-level project overview** (1-2 paragraphs max)
✅ **Core architecture** (bullet points, not essays)
✅ **Tech stack** (just the essentials)
✅ **Critical conventions** (only the must-follows)
✅ **Pointers to other docs** (not the content itself)

## What DOESN'T belong in CLAUDE.md
❌ Implementation details
❌ Step-by-step guides
❌ Code examples
❌ Historical changes
❌ Debugging notes
❌ Feature-specific documentation

## Keep CLAUDE.md Signal-Rich
1. **One-page rule**: Should fit on one screen
2. **Bullet points**: Not paragraphs
3. **Links, not content**: Point to cheatsheets for details
4. **Essentials only**: If Claude can work without it, it goes elsewhere

## Where Details Go Instead

| Content Type | Goes In |
|-------------|---------|
| What changed | CHANGELOG.md |
| Why we chose X | DECISIONS.md |
| How to do X | cheatsheets/[topic].md |
| API details | cheatsheets/api.md |
| Testing guide | cheatsheets/testing.md |
| Complex workflows | cheatsheets/[workflow].md |

## Example: Adding Redis Caching

### ❌ BAD (Too much detail in CLAUDE.md):
```md
## Tech Stack
- Redis for caching Monte Carlo results using Bull queue with 
  TTL of 3600 seconds and connection pooling configured with
  max 10 connections...
```

### ✅ GOOD (High-level in CLAUDE.md):
```md
## Tech Stack
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL, Redis, BullMQ
```

### Then create `cheatsheets/redis-caching.md` for details:
```md
# Redis Caching Setup
- Monte Carlo results: 1hr TTL
- Connection pool: max 10
- Queue: BullMQ for background jobs
...
```

## Review Checklist
Before adding to CLAUDE.md, ask:
1. Is this architectural or implementation?
2. Will this matter in 6 months?
3. Can this go in a cheatsheet instead?
4. Am I adding more than 2-3 lines?

If any answer is "implementation", "no", "yes", or "yes" → use a cheatsheet!
