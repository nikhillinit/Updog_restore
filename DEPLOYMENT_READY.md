# Staging Deployment - Ready to Execute

Your CI/CD infrastructure is excellent! GitHub Actions will handle the build.

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Commit validation work
git add .
git commit -m "feat: Complete validation gates (XIRR 100%, DPI null, Status)"

# 2. Push to trigger deployment
git push origin feat/merge-ready-refinements

# OR merge to main first:
git checkout main
git merge feat/merge-ready-refinements
git push origin main
```

GitHub Actions will:
- Build on Linux (no Windows npm issues!)
- Create Docker image
- Deploy to GCP Cloud Run
- Run health checks

Timeline: 5-10 minutes
