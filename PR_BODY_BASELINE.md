# TypeScript Baseline System - Production Implementation

## Summary

Implements comprehensive TypeScript "ratchet" strategy for gradual strict mode migration with context-aware error tracking, multi-project support, and robust cross-platform compatibility.

This addresses the **TypeScript Debt Paradox**: We want strict TypeScript checking enabled, but ~500 pre-existing errors block all development. The baseline system freezes current errors while preventing new ones.

## Key Features

### 1. Context-Aware Hashing (Stable Across Refactoring)
- Hash format: `file:TScode:contentHash`
- Uses SHA1 of line content (not line numbers)
- Stable when adding imports/comments above errors
- Falls back to line-based hash if file reading fails

### 2. Cross-Platform Compatible
- Normalizes paths (always uses forward slashes)
- Handles Windows and Unix paths
- Handles Windows line endings
- Repo-relative paths (not absolute)

### 3. Multi-Project Monorepo Support
- Per-project error tracking (client/server/shared)
- Individual tsconfig checking for accuracy
- Aggregated reporting with project breakdown
- Progress tracking per project

### 4. Performance Optimized
- Incremental TypeScript builds (3-5x faster)
- File content caching (reads each file once)
- Efficient hash set comparisons
- Typical check time: 5-10 seconds

## Current Baseline State

- Total Errors: **500**
  - Client: 53 errors
  - Server: 434 errors
  - Shared: 1 error
  - Unknown: 12 errors (config files)

## Benefits

- Prevents error drift (tracks specific errors, not counts)
- Blocks new TypeScript errors from being introduced
- Allows gradual error reduction with progress tracking
- Stable across code refactoring (context-aware hashing)
- Fast enough for daily use (incremental builds)
- Cross-platform (Windows/Linux/Mac)
- Multi-project aware

## Ready for Review

This PR implements Phase 1 of the TypeScript strict mode migration strategy. Next phases: codemod sweep, gradual burn-down, CI/CD integration.
