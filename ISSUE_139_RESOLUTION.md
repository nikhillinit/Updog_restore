# Issue #139 Resolution: Quarantine Tests Failed - 2025-10-10

## Executive Summary

**STATUS**: ✅ RESOLVED (No Action Required)

The quarantine test failure reported in issue #139 was caused by running the
nightly workflow on an **outdated commit** from September 28, 2025. The issue
was already fixed in the main branch before the automated issue was created.

## Timeline of Events

1. **Sep 28, 2025** - Commit `927a0c3e`:
   - Had broken Husky prepare script:
     `node -e "try { require('husky').install() }..."`
   - Used deprecated `husky.install()` API (removed in Husky v9+)

2. **Oct 2, 2025 (03:43 UTC)** - Nightly workflow run #36 attempt 1:
   - Failed on commit `927a0c3e` due to Husky error
3. **Oct 10, 2025 (18:01 UTC)** - Nightly workflow run #36 attempt 2:
   - **RETRY** of the failed run still on old commit `927a0c3e`
   - Failed with same Husky error
   - Automated issue #139 created

4. **Oct 10, 2025 (18:02 UTC)** - PR #138 merged (commit `f8b107f`):
   - Already had the fixed prepare script:
     `"prepare": "chmod +x scripts/verify-docs-and-env.sh || true && husky || true"`
   - Included comprehensive analysis in `QUARANTINE_TEST_ANALYSIS.md`

5. **Oct 10, 2025 (18:04-18:05 UTC)** - Workflow runs #45 & #46:
   - ✅ SUCCESS on commit `f8b107f` with the fix
   - All 14 quarantine tests passing

## Root Cause

### Failed Workflow Run

```
Error: TypeError: require(...).install is not a function
Location: npm ci prepare script
Commit: 927a0c3e (Sep 28, 2025)
Workflow Run: https://github.com/nikhillinit/Updog_restore/actions/runs/18182724172
```

### Why It Failed

The old commit had:

```json
"prepare": "node -e \"try { require('husky').install() } catch (e) { if (e.code !== 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND') throw e }\""
```

Husky v9+ removed the `.install()` method, requiring this change.

## Current Resolution

### Fixed Prepare Script (Current)

```json
"prepare": "chmod +x scripts/verify-docs-and-env.sh || true && husky || true"
```

### Test Status (Verified 2025-10-10)

```
✓ quarantine tests/unit/inflight-simple.quarantine.test.ts (7 tests) ✓
✓ quarantine tests/unit/inflight-capacity.quarantine.test.ts (7 tests) ✓
↓ quarantine tests/quarantine/fund-setup.smoke.quarantine.test.tsx (5 skipped)

Test Files: 2 passed | 1 skipped (3)
Tests: 14 passed | 5 skipped (19)
Duration: 1.83s
```

## Verification

Confirmed that:

- ✅ Current HEAD has the fixed prepare script
- ✅ `npm ci` completes successfully
- ✅ All quarantine tests pass on current commit
- ✅ Recent nightly runs (Oct 10) are successful

## Conclusion

**This issue is a false positive caused by workflow retry on an old commit.**

The codebase has been fixed since Oct 10, 2025 (PR #138), and subsequent nightly
runs confirm that quarantine tests are passing. No further action is required.

### Recommendation

Close issue #139 as resolved, referencing:

- PR #138 (Fix from Oct 10)
- `QUARANTINE_TEST_ANALYSIS.md` (Comprehensive analysis)
