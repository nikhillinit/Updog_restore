# GitHub Setup Guide - Push to UpDawg Repository

This guide will help you push the POVC Fund Model application to your GitHub repository at https://github.com/nikhillinit/UpDawg.git

## 🚀 Quick Setup Commands

### Step 1: Initialize Git (in your local environment)

Since Git operations can't be performed directly in Replit, you'll need to do this on your local machine or another environment with Git access.

```bash
# Download/copy all files from this Replit to your local machine
# Then navigate to the project directory and run:

# Initialize git repository
git init

# Add all files to staging
git add .

# Create initial commit
git commit -m "Initial commit: POVC Fund Model application

- Complete VC fund management application
- React + TypeScript frontend with Shadcn/ui
- Express.js backend with in-memory storage
- 25+ chart types with Recharts
- Comprehensive documentation for team collaboration
- Production-ready codebase with TypeScript strict mode"

# Add your GitHub repository as remote origin
git remote add origin https://github.com/nikhillinit/UpDawg.git

# Push to GitHub
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 2: Alternative - Download and Push

If you prefer to download files from Replit:

1. **Download from Replit**:
   - Use the download option in Replit to get all files
   - Or manually copy the important files listed below

2. **Setup on Local Machine**:
   ```bash
   # Create new directory
   mkdir UpDawg
   cd UpDawg
   
   # Initialize git
   git init
   
   # Copy all downloaded files to this directory
   # Then add and commit
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit: POVC Fund Model application"
   
   # Add remote and push
   git remote add origin https://github.com/nikhillinit/UpDawg.git
   git branch -M main
   git push -u origin main
   ```
