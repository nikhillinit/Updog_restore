## Artifact-by-Artifact Analysis

### 1. ADR 0001 — Iteration-A Deterministic Engine ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Does:**
- Freezes scope to deterministic engine only
- Defines 8 accounting invariants (matches our validation need)
- Specifies frozen I/O schema (CSV/JSON with lineage)
- Explicitly excludes waterfalls, recycling, Monte Carlo from Iteration-A

**How It Helps:**
- ✅ **Prevents scope creep** (Integration Agent found only 33% wired, risk of adding more)
- ✅ **Codifies the 8 invariants** (Test Suite Agent found these missing in CI)
- ✅ **Documents lineage fields** (`model_version_hash`, `input_checksum`) for parity
- ✅ **Provides decision authority** (when PM asks "can we add X?" → point to ADR)

**Integration with Our Findings:**
| Our Finding | ADR Solution |
|-------------|--------------|
| Integration gaps (2/6 engines wired) | Scope freeze prevents adding more engines |
| Test suite missing invariants | ADR defines exact 8 invariants to implement |
| Parity tests failing | ADR specifies golden dataset structure |
| Strategic confusion (3 competing docs) | ADR becomes single source of truth |

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ADOPT IMMEDIATELY** - Drop into `docs/adrs/` and reference in all PRs

---

### 2. CONTRIBUTING.md (Trunk-based, Thin Slices) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Does:**
- Enforces ≤400 LOC per PR
- Defines PR-blocking CI gates (typecheck → lint → unit → parity → perf)
- Requires ADR linkage in PR descriptions
- Golden dataset change policy (must explain "why")

**How It Helps:**
- ✅ **Reduces branch chaos** (CI Agent found 54 branches, 16 open PRs)
- ✅ **Enforces quality gates** (CI Agent found 66% failure rate - this fixes)
- ✅ **Prevents type errors** (TypeScript Agent found 695 errors - strict mode required)
- ✅ **Formalizes golden dataset process** (Test Suite Agent found parity tests broken)

**Integration with Our Findings:**
| Our Finding | CONTRIBUTING Solution |
|-------------|----------------------|
| 66% CI failure rate | Defined gate order: typecheck → lint → unit → parity → perf |
| 695 TypeScript errors | Mandatory `tsc --noEmit` + strict mode enforcement |
| 64.5% test pass rate | Unit tests are PR-blocking, must pass |
| Parity tests broken | Golden dataset process formalized |
| 54 branches | Trunk-based + small PRs reduces branch count |

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ADOPT WITH MINOR TWEAKS** - Excellent foundation, add our specific test commands

---

### 3. CI Workflow Reorder (.github/workflows/ci.yml) ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Does:**
- Fast-fail path: typecheck → lint → unit → parity → perf
- Parallel size-limit (advisory, non-blocking)
- Nightly workflow for flaky tests
- Artifact upload on failure (parity diffs, perf reports)

**How It Helps:**
- ✅ **Fixes 66% CI failure rate** (proper gate order, fail-fast)
- ✅ **Validates parity in CI** (Test Suite Agent found parity tests can't execute)
- ✅ **Separates flaky from critical** (CI Agent found flaky test issues)
- ✅ **Reduces workflow count** (CI Agent found 57 workflows, this consolidates)

**Integration with Our Findings:**
| Our Finding | CI Workflow Solution |
|-------------|---------------------|
| 15 failing workflows | Consolidated to single decisive workflow |
| Parity tests failing (missing csv-parse) | Dedicated parity job with artifact upload |
| No performance gates | Explicit perf_smoke job with budgets |
| Flaky tests blocking | Nightly workflow for flaky tests |
| 57 total workflows | This replaces 10+ redundant workflows |

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ADOPT WITH INTEGRATION** - Replace current failing workflows

---

### 4. Package Scripts & Scaffolding ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Provides:**
```json
{
  "typecheck": "tsc --noEmit",
  "test:parity": "node scripts/parity-check.mjs",
  "test:perf:smoke": "node scripts/perf-smoke.mjs",
  "test:flaky": "vitest run \"**/*.flaky.test.{ts,tsx}\"",
  "golden:update": "node scripts/golden-update.mjs"
}
```

**How It Helps:**
- ✅ **Standardizes commands** (CI Agent found inconsistent npm scripts)
- ✅ **Implements parity checking** (Test Suite Agent found parity tests broken)
- ✅ **Adds performance gates** (missing from current setup)
- ✅ **Quarantines flaky tests** (CI Agent identified flaky test issues)

**Integration with Our Findings:**
| Our Finding | Package Scripts Solution |
|-------------|-------------------------|
| Parity tests failing | `test:parity` script with tolerance checking |
| No perf gates | `test:perf:smoke` with budget enforcement |
| Flaky tests | `test:flaky` for nightly runs |
| Inconsistent commands | Standardized script names |

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ADOPT AND EXTEND** - Add to package.json, create scripts

---

### 5. Parity & Perf Scripts (scripts/parity-check.mjs) ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Does:**
- Compares current outputs to golden CSVs
- Numeric tolerance checking (≤1e-6)
- Fails process on mismatch
- Generates parity-diff artifact on failure

**How It Helps:**
- ✅ **Fixes parity testing** (Test Suite Agent found parity tests can't execute)
- ✅ **Implements Excel parity** (1e-6 tolerance matches financial accuracy needs)
- ✅ **Creates audit trail** (diffs uploaded as CI artifacts)

**Integration with Our Findings:**
| Our Finding | Parity Script Solution |
|-------------|----------------------|
| Parity tests failing (csv-parse import) | Pure Node.js fs-based comparison |
| Missing golden datasets | Reads from tests/golden/expected |
| No tolerance checking | 1e-6 tolerance for numeric values |
| No CI artifacts | Uploads .parity-diffs on failure |

**Recommendation:** ⭐⭐⭐⭐ **ADOPT WITH ADAPTATION** - Good foundation, needs integration with existing structure

**Adaptation Needed:**
- Current golden files are in `tests/parity/golden/` (ChatGPT assumes `tests/golden/`)
- Need to integrate with existing `excel-parity.test.ts` structure

---

### 6. PR Template & CODEOWNERS ⭐⭐⭐⭐

**What It Does:**
- PR template with ADR linkage requirement
- Golden dataset change explanation
- CODEOWNERS for /src/engine, /tests/golden, /scripts

**How It Helps:**
- ✅ **Enforces process** (prevents ad-hoc changes)
- ✅ **Protects critical paths** (engine + tests + scripts)
- ✅ **Requires documentation** (ADR linkage)

**Integration with Our Findings:**
| Our Finding | Template/CODEOWNERS Solution |
|-------------|------------------------------|
| Strategic confusion | ADR linkage required in all PRs |
| Parity test changes | Must explain golden dataset updates |
| 16 open PRs | Template standardizes PR quality |

**Recommendation:** ✅ **ADOPT IMMEDIATELY** - Zero-cost governance improvement

- Phased fixing approach (null safety → type mismatches → unused code)
- Estimated 70-98 hours

---

### Gap 2: Doesn't Address Test Suite Stabilization
**ChatGPT Provides:** Unit tests as PR-blocking gate
**Missing:** How to fix current 64.5% pass rate

**Our Addition:**
- Fix crypto module mocking (67 test failures)
- Fix database transaction mocks (transaction.abort)
- Complete schema mocks (50+ test failures)
- Estimated 8-15 hours

---

### Gap 3: Doesn't Address Engine-UI Wiring
**ChatGPT Provides:** Scope freeze (good - prevents adding more)
**Missing:** Plan to wire existing 4 unwired engines

**Our Addition:**

- UI component integration
- Estimated 30-44 hours

---

### Gap 4: Path Adjustments for Existing Structure
**ChatGPT Assumes:**
- `tests/golden/expected/` (we have `tests/parity/golden/`)
- `src/engine/index.ts` (we have `shared/core/reserves/`, `client/src/core/`)
- Vitest (we have vitest ✅)

**Our Adjustments:**
- Update paths in scripts to match our structure
- Use existing engine locations
- Integrate with current test setup

---

## Integration Strategy: ChatGPT + Multi-Agent Consensus

### Phase 1: Governance (Day 1 - 2 hours)
✅ **Drop in ChatGPT artifacts with path adjustments:**

1. **ADR 0001** → `docs/adrs/0001-iteration-a-deterministic-engine.md`
   - Update paths: `tests/parity/golden/` not `tests/golden/`
   - Add reference to existing engines in `shared/core/reserves/`

2. **CONTRIBUTING.md** → root
   - Update test commands to match our package.json
   - Reference our 8 invariants from STRATEGY-SUMMARY.md

3. **CI Workflow** → `.github/workflows/ci-iteration-a.yml`
   - Adjust to use our npm scripts
   - Keep csv-parse dependency fix we just made

4. **PR Template** → `.github/pull_request_template.md`
   - Reference ADR 0001
   - Add our specific checklist items

5. **CODEOWNERS** → root
   - Add `/shared/core/` (our engine location)
   - Add `/tests/parity/` (our golden datasets)

---

### Phase 2: Infrastructure (Day 1-2 - 6-8 hours)
✅ **Implement parity & perf scripts adapted to our structure:**

1. **Parity Script** → `scripts/parity-check.mjs`
   - Read from `tests/parity/golden/` (our location)
   - Integrate with existing `excel-parity.test.ts`
   - Use 1e-6 tolerance (matches our XIRR/TVPI/DPI spec)

2. **Perf Script** → `scripts/perf-smoke.mjs`
   - Call our existing engines
   - Set budget based on "p95 < 800ms" from our docs
   - Upload perf reports

3. **Golden Update Script** → `scripts/golden-update.mjs`
   - Generate `tests/parity/golden/current/*.csv` from engines
   - Use existing seed-fund-basic.csv as input

4. **Package Scripts** → Update `package.json`
   - Add ChatGPT's standardized commands
   - Keep our existing commands for compatibility

---

### Phase 3: Fix Existing Issues (Week 1-2 - 70-98 hours)
✅ **Use governance to guide fixes from multi-agent findings:**

1. **TypeScript Errors** (70-98 hours)
   - With strict mode enforced (CONTRIBUTING), fix 695 errors
   - CI gate prevents new errors
   - Phased approach: critical → medium → low priority

2. **Test Suite** (8-15 hours)
   - With unit tests PR-blocking (CI workflow), fix 64.5% pass rate
   - Golden parity gate enforces correctness
   - Separate flaky tests to nightly

3. **CI/CD** (12-20 hours)
   - Replace 15 failing workflows with ChatGPT's consolidated ci.yml
   - Reduce 57 workflows to ~10-15
   - Fix critical path: typecheck → unit → parity → perf

---

### Phase 4: Integration (Week 3-4 - 30-44 hours)
✅ **Wire engines under scope freeze (ADR 0001):**

1. **Within Scope** (Iteration-A):
   - LiquidityEngine ✅ (already wired)
   - ReserveEngine ⚠️ (partial, complete it)
   - DeterministicReserveEngine (wire to UI)

2. **Deferred** (Iteration-B per ADR):
   - PacingEngine (mark as "reserved for Iteration-B")
   - CohortEngine (mark as "reserved for Iteration-B")
   - MonteCarloEngine (explicitly out of scope per ADR)

**Result:** Reduces integration effort from 30-44 hours to ~15-20 hours by scoping down
