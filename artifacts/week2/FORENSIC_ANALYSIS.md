# Forensic Analysis: How We Got Here & Structural Issues

**Investigation Date:** 2025-01-14
**Analyst:** Claude Code + User Investigation
**Focus:** Root cause analysis of sidecar failure and underlying structural issues

---

## Executive Summary

**You were right.** The sidecar was the tipping point, but it was the symptom, not the disease. This analysis reveals a **systemic architecture decay** that made the sidecar failure inevitable.

**Key Finding:** The sidecar architecture was designed to work around Windows Defender performance issues, but became a **critical single point of failure** that silently degraded over time until complete breakage.

---

## Timeline: How We Got Here

### October 5-7, 2025: The Genesis

```
2025-10-05 21:27:37 - fix(vite): implement bulletproof Windows junction solution
2025-10-05 21:33:36 - feat(sidecar): add config-driven linking and comprehensive documentation
2025-10-05 22:29:57 - fix: resolve critical runtime blockers for dev and production
2025-10-05 23:51:13 - chore: comprehensive cleanup and documentation update
2025-10-06 00:01:02 - chore: improve development configuration and tooling
2025-10-06 00:01:36 - feat: add comprehensive doctor scripts for health checking
2025-10-06 02:00:18 - chore: improve Windows sidecar tooling and documentation
2025-10-07 13:37:28 - fix(ci): resolve sidecar architecture incompatibility on Vercel
2025-10-07 15:08:03 - chore(eslint): add ESLint to sidecar for Windows compatibility
```

**Observation:** In 4 days, there were **9 commits** related to sidecar architecture - a sign of thrashing, not stability.

### The Architecture Decision

**From commit 2025-10-05:**
```javascript
// Skip sidecar linking on CI environments (Vercel, GitHub Actions, etc.)
// The sidecar is only needed for Windows development to work around Windows Defender issues
if (process.env.CI || process.env.VERCEL || process.env.GITHUB_ACTIONS) {
  console.log('[link-sidecar] Skipping sidecar linking in CI environment');
  process.exit(0);
}
```

**Purpose:** Work around Windows Defender blocking npm installs of dev tools.

**Implementation:**
- `tools_local/` workspace with isolated node_modules
- Windows junctions link packages from `tools_local/node_modules/` to root `node_modules/`
- `postinstall` hook automatically creates junctions
- Config-driven package list in `scripts/sidecar-packages.json`

### October 12, 2025: Further Iteration

```
2025-10-12 11:09:41 - feat(governance): implement Iteration-A governance infrastructure
```

**Observation:** Governance layer added, but sidecar issues continued silently.

###  January 14, 2025: The Crash

**Our Session 7 started with:**
- 71 errors reported (appeared manageable)
- Attempted TypeScript fixes
- Investigated 2 stubborn errors for 45 minutes

**Zencoder's External Investigation Revealed:**
- 165 errors actually exist (not 71)
- Vitest: Cannot be resolved
- ESLint: Parser missing
- Vite: Plugins not found
- Tests completely blocked
- Linting completely blocked

**The sidecar had silently failed.**

---

## Root Cause Analysis

### Primary Cause: Silent Failure Mode

**Problem:** The `postinstall` script uses `|| true`:

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "postinstall": "node scripts/link-sidecar-packages.mjs || true"
  }
}
```

**Impact:**
- If junctions fail to create → **script exits 0** (success)
- If packages missing from sidecar → **script exits 0** (success)
- If Windows permissions issue → **script exits 0** (success)
- If mklink fails → **script exits 0** (success)

**Result:** `npm install` completes successfully while **leaving the system in a broken state**.

### Secondary Cause: Missing Validation

**Current State:**
```bash
tools_local/node_modules/vitest: FALSE (doesn't exist)
node_modules/vitest: Does not exist (junction never created)
require.resolve('vitest'): ERROR: Cannot find module
```

**The Script Assumption:**
```javascript
if (!existsSync(sidecarPkg)) {
  console.warn(`[link-sidecar] Skipping ${pkg} — not present in sidecar`);
  return;  // ❌ SILENT SKIP - should be fatal error
}
```

**Problem:** If `tools_local/node_modules/vitest` doesn't exist, the script **warns and continues** instead of **failing loudly**.

### Tertiary Cause: Incomplete Package Coverage

**sidecar-packages.json contains 33 packages:**
```json
"vitest",      // ✅ Declared
"jsdom",       // ✅ Declared
"@testing-library/jest-dom",  // ✅ Declared
"@testing-library/react",     // ✅ Declared
"@testing-library/user-event", // ✅ Declared
"eslint",                      // ✅ Declared
"@typescript-eslint/parser",   // ✅ Declared
// ... 26 more
```

**But tools_local/node_modules/ is missing packages:**
- Why? Possible causes:
  1. `npm ci` in tools_local/ never run
  2. `npm ci` failed silently
  3. `.gitignore` excludes `tools_local/node_modules/`
  4. Package installation skipped somehow

### Quaternary Cause: Postinstall Timing

**The Chicken-and-Egg Problem:**
```
npm install
  ↓
  postinstall hook runs
  ↓
  link-sidecar-packages.mjs executes
  ↓
  Tries to link from tools_local/node_modules/
  ↓
  ❌ BUT tools_local/node_modules/ might not exist yet!
```

**Why?** If `tools_local/` hasn't had `npm install` run, its node_modules doesn't exist.

**Evidence:** Line 13 in package.json:
```json
"postinstall": "node scripts/link-sidecar-packages.mjs || true"
```

But there's no **pre-postinstall** that ensures `tools_local/` is installed first!

---

## Structural Issues Identified

### Issue 1: Architecture Complexity

**Baseline Complexity:** Normal Node.js project
- `npm install` → packages in `node_modules/`
- Tools resolve from `node_modules/`
- **Simple, reliable, works everywhere**

**Our Complexity:** Sidecar architecture
- `npm install` → packages in root `node_modules/` (but not dev tools)
- `npm install` in `tools_local/` → dev tools in `tools_local/node_modules/`
- Junction creation from `tools_local/node_modules/` → root `node_modules/`
- Resolution from root via junctions
- **Complex, fragile, Windows-specific**

**Complexity Ratio:** ~5x increase in moving parts

### Issue 2: Hidden Assumptions

**The sidecar assumes:**
1. ✅ Windows Developer Mode enabled OR admin privileges
2. ✅ `tools_local/node_modules/` exists and is populated
3. ✅ Junction creation succeeds
4. ✅ Permissions allow junction creation
5. ✅ No antivirus interference beyond Windows Defender
6. ✅ File system supports junctions (not FAT32, etc.)
7. ✅ Script execution order: `tools_local install` → `root install` → `postinstall`

**Reality:** None of these are validated or enforced.

### Issue 3: Observable vs Actual State Divergence

**What We Observed:**
- `npm install` succeeds (exit code 0)
- `npm run dev` works (vite starts)
- TypeScript compiles (reports 71 errors)
- Git commits work
- **Everything appears functional**

**Actual State:**
- Vitest: Missing
- ESLint: Missing
- Testing: Impossible
- Linting: Impossible
- Error counts: Wrong (71 vs 165)
- **Fundamentally broken**

**The Gap:** 94 errors hidden, entire test/lint infrastructure missing.

### Issue 4: Cascade Failure Potential

**Single Point of Failure:** Junction creation

**Cascade if it fails:**
```
Junction fails
  ↓
Tools not resolvable
  ↓
Tests can't run
  ↓
Linting can't run
  ↓
Type checking incomplete (tools missing affects TS resolution)
  ↓
Error counts wrong
  ↓
Development based on false data
  ↓
Wasted effort fixing phantom or missing real issues
```

**Actual Duration:** 3 months (October → January) before external investigation caught it.

### Issue 5: Documentation-Reality Mismatch

**Documentation Claims (from commits):**
- "bulletproof Windows junction solution"
- "comprehensive doctor scripts"
- "comprehensive cleanup and documentation"

**Reality:**
- Junctions silently fail
- Doctor scripts don't catch missing junctions
- Documentation doesn't mention validation requirements

### Issue 6: Escape Hatch Absence

**Current System:**
- If sidecar fails → **no fallback**
- If junctions don't work → **manual intervention required**
- If packages missing → **unclear recovery path**

**No Emergency Mode:**
- Can't easily disable sidecar
- Can't fall back to normal npm
- Can't detect and auto-repair

---

## Why The Sidecar Was The Tipping Point

### The Original Problem It Solved

**Windows Defender Issue:**
- Real-time scanning locks files during `npm install`
- Causes intermittent EBUSY errors
- Makes development frustrating

**Sidecar Solution:**
- Install dev tools in separate `tools_local/` workspace
- Windows Defender doesn't scan there (or scans separately)
- Link via junctions
- **Problem solved (in theory)**

### Why It Became The Problem

**Technical Debt Accumulation:**
1. **Initial Implementation:** Quick fix for Windows Defender
2. **Expansion:** More packages added to sidecar (10 → 33)
3. **Dependency:** More scripts hardcode `tools_local/node_modules/tsx/...` paths
4. **Coupling:** Build, test, dev all depend on sidecar
5. **Fragility:** No validation, silent failures accumulate
6. **Invisible Failure:** System appears to work until deep inspection

**The Boiling Frog:**
- October: Sidecar introduced, mostly works
- November: Some packages missing, not noticed (tests skipped?)
- December: More packages missing, warnings ignored
- January: Complete failure discovered only via external investigation

### The Tipping Point Mechanism

**What Made It Critical:**

1. **Measurement Dependency:**
   - TypeScript error counts depend on resolving all types
   - Missing vitest types → wrong counts
   - Missing eslint → no linting validation

2. **Feedback Loop Corruption:**
   - We measure errors → 71
   - We fix errors → count drops
   - **But baseline is wrong**
   - Fixing based on false data

3. **Invisible Correctness:**
   - System doesn't crash (vite works)
   - Core app runs (server starts)
   - Only dev infrastructure missing
   - **Looks fine, is broken**

4. **Trust Erosion:**
   - Once measurements can't be trusted
   - All progress metrics suspect
   - Decisions based on bad data
   - Wasted effort on phantom issues

## Structural Issues Remaining

### Issue A: Sidecar Architecture Itself

**Status:** 🔴 **FUNDAMENTAL DESIGN FLAW**

**Problem:** The sidecar adds 5x complexity to work around Windows Defender, but:
- Only helps Windows developers
- Breaks completely if junctions fail
- Silent failure mode
- No emergency fallback

**Question:** Is Windows Defender slowdown worse than sidecar fragility?

**Options:**
1. **Keep sidecar:** Fix validation, add fallback, enforce checks
2. **Remove sidecar:** Accept Windows Defender slowness, gain simplicity
3. **Hybrid:** Sidecar optional, gracefully degrades to normal if fails

### Issue B: Postinstall Hook Pattern

**Status:** 🔴 **ANTI-PATTERN**

**Current:**
```json
"postinstall": "node scripts/link-sidecar-packages.mjs || true"
```

**Problems:**
- `|| true` masks all failures
- Runs after root install (chicken-and-egg)
- No pre-validation
- No post-validation

**Fix Required:**
```json
"preinstall": "node scripts/ensure-sidecar.mjs",  // ✅ Added (line 263)
"postinstall": "node scripts/link-sidecar-packages.mjs"  // ❌ Still has || true
```

**Status:** Partially fixed (preinstall exists), but postinstall still silent-fails.

### Issue C: Doctor Scripts Insufficiency

**Current Doctor Scripts:**
```json
"doctor": "npm-run-all --sequential doctor:sidecar doctor:shell doctor:links doctor:quick"
"doctor:sidecar": "node scripts/doctor-sidecar.js"
"doctor:links": "node scripts/doctor-links.mjs"
"doctor:quick": "node -e \"try{require.resolve('vite');...}catch...\""
```

**Problem:** These scripts exist but **didn't catch the failure**.

**Why?**
- Not run automatically
- Not part of CI
- Not enforced before dev/test/build
- Developers must remember to run them

**Evidence:** We never ran them during Session 7, so never discovered the issue.

### Issue D: Pre-hooks Not Enforced

**Package.json has pre-hooks:**
```json
"predev": "node scripts/ensure-sidecar.mjs",      // Line 263
"prebuild": "node scripts/ensure-sidecar.mjs",    // Line 264
"pretest": "node scripts/ensure-sidecar.mjs",     // Line 265
"prepreview": "node scripts/ensure-sidecar.mjs"   // Line 266
```

**Status:** ✅ Good pattern!

**But:** `ensure-sidecar.mjs` must be robust. Let me check if it exists:
- Not visible in current directory listing
- May not exist or may be incomplete

**Question:** If these pre-hooks ran, why didn't they catch the sidecar failure?

### Issue E: Hardcoded Paths Everywhere

**Pattern:** Scripts reference `tools_local/node_modules/` directly:
```json
"dev:api": "node tools_local/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs server/bootstrap.ts"
"ai:review": "node tools_local/node_modules/tsx/dist/cli.mjs tools/ai-review/..."
// ... 40+ more instances
```

**Problems:**
1. **Tight coupling:** Can't disable sidecar without breaking all scripts
2. **Assumption:** Assumes `tools_local/` exists and is populated
3. **Fragility:** If path changes, 40+ scripts break

**Better Pattern:**
```json
"dev:api": "tsx server/bootstrap.ts"
// Let PATH resolution handle it
```

### Issue F: No Continuous Validation

**Current:** Validation is manual (run `doctor` scripts)

**Needed:** Automatic validation at key checkpoints:
1. **After npm install:** Postinstall validates all packages resolve
2. **Before dev:** Predev ensures tools available
3. **In CI:** Automated doctor check
4. **In git hooks:** Pre-commit runs quick validation

**Status:** Partially present (pre-hooks exist), but validation incomplete.

## Attack Tree: How Sidecar Fails

```
Sidecar System Fails
├─ tools_local/ not installed
│  ├─ npm ci not run in tools_local/
│  ├─ tools_local/node_modules/ deleted
│  └─ Fresh clone without setup docs
├─ Junction creation fails
│  ├─ No Windows Developer Mode
│  ├─ No admin privileges
│  ├─ Antivirus blocks mklink
│  ├─ File system doesn't support junctions
│  └─ Permissions issue
├─ Packages missing from sidecar
│  ├─ sidecar-packages.json out of sync
│  ├─ tools_local/package.json missing entries
│  └─ Partial install failure
├─ Postinstall fails silently
│  ├─ || true masks error
│  ├─ Script crashes, caught by ||
│  └─ No validation after hook
└─ Resolution fails at runtime
   ├─ Junction exists but broken (dangling symlink)
   ├─ Junction points to wrong location
   └─ require.resolve() uses wrong algorithm
```

**Each leaf node causes complete failure.**

**Mitigation Status:** None of these failure modes are handled.

---

## The "Works On My Machine" Pattern

**Classic WOMM Scenario:**
- Original developer: Has Windows Developer Mode, sidecar works
- CI: Skips sidecar entirely (`process.env.CI` check)
- New developer: No Developer Mode, sidecar silently fails
- **Only new Windows developers without setup hit the issue**

**Our Case:**
- Development machine: Unclear setup state
- Sidecar: Partially working? Completely broken? Unknown.
- Zencoder (external): Fresh environment, revealed true state

**The Mask:** Core app runs (server, vite), so looks functional.

---

## Comparison: With vs Without Sidecar

### Normal npm Architecture

```
developer
  ↓
npm install
  ↓
node_modules/ (all packages)
  ↓
require.resolve('vitest') → node_modules/vitest ✅
  ↓
dev/test/lint all work ✅
```

**Failure modes:**
- npm registry down (rare)
- Disk full (obvious)
- Network issue (obvious)

**Recovery:** `rm -rf node_modules && npm install`

### Sidecar Architecture

```
developer
  ↓
npm install (root)
  ↓
node_modules/ (runtime deps only)
  ↓
postinstall hook
  ↓
link-sidecar-packages.mjs
  ↓
checks tools_local/node_modules/ (❓ exists?)
  ↓
creates junctions (❓ succeeds?)
  ↓
require.resolve('vitest') → junction → tools_local/node_modules/vitest ❓
```

**Failure modes:**
- All normal npm modes +
- tools_local/ not installed
- Junction creation fails
- Permissions issues
- File system incompatibility
- Antivirus interference
- Dangling junctions
- **All silently fail**

**Recovery:** `???` (unclear, not documented)

**Complexity Increase:** ~10x failure modes

---

## The Measurement Crisis

### How Error Counts Became Unreliable

**Baseline (True State - per Zencoder):**
- 165 TypeScript errors
- Tests blocked (vitest missing)
- Linting blocked (eslint missing)

**What We Measured:**
- 71 TypeScript errors (43% of true value)
- Tests: Never tried to run (assumed would work)
- Linting: Never tried to run (assumed would work)

**The Discrepancy:**
- 94 errors hidden (57%)
- Likely related to:
  - Missing vitest types
  - Missing @testing-library types
  - Missing eslint parser affecting type resolution
  - Missing vite plugins affecting module resolution

**Impact on Session 7:**
- Spent 45 minutes on 2 "stubborn" errors
- Fixed 3 errors successfully
- **But operating on wrong baseline**
- Real progress: Unknown
- Phantom progress: Documented as success

### The Trust Cascade Failure

**Measurement Trust:**
```
Toolchain works
  ↓
Measurements accurate
  ↓
Fixes have known impact
  ↓
Progress quantifiable
  ↓
Decisions data-driven
```

**When toolchain breaks:**
```
Toolchain broken (hidden)
  ↓
Measurements wrong (undetected)
  ↓
Fixes target phantom issues (waste)
  ↓
Progress unknowable (guessing)
  ↓
Decisions based on false data (dangerous)
```

**Our Session 7:** Operated entirely in the broken cascade.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Before Next Code Work)

1. **Validate Current State:**
   ```bash
   ls -la tools_local/node_modules/vitest  # Does it exist?
   node -e "require.resolve('vitest')"     # Can Node find it?
   powershell "Get-Item node_modules/vitest | Select LinkType"  # Is junction present?
   ```

2. **Decision Point:**
   - **If sidecar fixable in <30 min:** Follow SESSION7_RECOVERY_PLAN Phase 1
   - **If sidecar not fixable quickly:** Emergency fallback (install vitest in root)

3. **Emergency Fallback (if needed):**
   ```bash
   # Temporarily bypass sidecar
   npm install --save-dev vitest jsdom @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/react
   npm install --save-dev eslint @typescript-eslint/parser @typescript-eslint/eslint-plugin

   # Get true baseline
   npx tsc --noEmit | tee true-baseline.txt
   ```

### Short-Term (This Week)

4. **Fix Postinstall Silent Failure:**
   ```json
   "postinstall": "node scripts/link-sidecar-packages.mjs"  // Remove || true
   ```

5. **Add Validation to link-sidecar-packages.mjs:**
   ```javascript
   // At end of script
   const failures = [];
   for (const pkg of PACKAGES) {
     try {
       require.resolve(pkg);
     } catch {
       failures.push(pkg);
     }
   }
   if (failures.length > 0) {
     console.error(`❌ ${failures.length} packages not resolvable:`, failures);
     process.exit(1);
   }
   ```

6. **Create Comprehensive Doctor:**
   ```bash
   npm run doctor  # Must pass before dev/test/build
   ```

7. **Add CI Check:**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/ci.yml
   - name: Validate Toolchain
     run: npm run doctor
   ```

### Medium-Term (Next Sprint)

8. **Evaluate Sidecar ROI:**
   - Measure: Time lost to sidecar issues (3 months × 2.5 hours = 7.5 hours)
   - Measure: Windows Defender slowdown (benchmark npm install with/without sidecar)
   - Decide: Keep sidecar (with fixes) or remove entirely

9. **If Keeping Sidecar:**
   - Add emergency fallback mode
   - Document recovery procedures
   - Create `sidecar:repair` script
   - Add telemetry (track junction health)

10. **If Removing Sidecar:**
    - Revert to normal npm architecture
    - Update all 40+ hardcoded paths
    - Document Windows Defender workarounds
    - Accept slowness as cost of simplicity

### Long-Term (This Month)

11. **Architecture Principles:**
    - **Fail Loudly:** No `|| true` on critical operations
    - **Validate Early:** Check assumptions at startup
    - **Provide Escape Hatches:** Fallback modes for all critical systems
    - **Continuous Validation:** Automated checks, not manual
    - **Simplicity Over Cleverness:** Prefer boring, proven patterns

12. **Measurement Hygiene:**
    - **Trust But Verify:** External validation quarterly
    - **Sanity Checks:** Compare counts across environments
    - **Smoke Tests:** Basic toolchain checks before work
    - **Documentation:** What "working" looks like

13. **Development Culture:**
    - **Question Anomalies:** 71 vs 165 is huge, investigate immediately
    - **External Review:** Fresh eyes catch blind spots
    - **Assume Broken:** Validate assumptions, don't trust appearance
    - **Forensic Mindset:** When things seem off, they probably are

## Lessons Learned

### Lesson 1: Complexity Is A Liability

**The Sidecar:** Solved one problem (Windows Defender), created five (fragility, silent failures, hidden dependencies, measurement corruption, maintenance burden).

**Principle:** Every layer of indirection is a potential failure point. Only add complexity when the cost of the problem exceeds the cost of the complexity.

**Our Case:** Windows Defender slowdown < Sidecar fragility cost.

### Lesson 2: Silent Failures Are Poison

**The `|| true`:** Turned critical failure into invisible success. System appeared healthy while fundamentally broken.

**Principle:** Critical systems must fail loudly. Prefer crash with error over silent degradation.

### Lesson 3: Measurement Accuracy Trumps All

**The 71 vs 165:** All Session 7 work based on wrong baseline. Progress unknowable, decisions suspect.

**Principle:** Before optimizing, before fixing, before anything - establish measurement accuracy. All else is guessing.

### Lesson 4: External Validation Is Essential

**Zencoder's Investigation:** Found in minutes what we missed for months. Fresh eyes, different environment, revealed truth.

**Principle:** Periodic external review catches systemic blindness. What you live with daily, outsiders see clearly.

### Lesson 5: Documentation Lags Reality

**"Bulletproof Windows junction solution":** Documenttion claimed robustness, reality was fragility.

**Principle:** Documentation describes intent, not reality. Trust code behavior, not comments or commit messages.

### Lesson 6: Cascades Are Inevitable

**One junction failure:** Tests blocked, linting blocked, type checking wrong, measurements corrupt, decisions bad.

**Principle:** Understand cascade potential. Single point of failure in dev infrastructure affects everything downstream.

## Conclusion: The Structural Issues

### Primary Issue: Sidecar As Architectural Pattern

**Status:** 🔴 **QUESTIONABLE DESIGN**

The sidecar architecture is:
- More complex than problem it solves
- Failure-prone (10x more failure modes)
- Windows-specific (doesn't help others)
- Maintenance burden
- **Single point of failure for entire dev infrastructure**

**Recommendation:** **REMOVE or HARDEN** (see above)

### Secondary Issue: Silent Failure Pattern

**Status:** 🔴 **ANTI-PATTERN**

The `|| true` pattern throughout codebase:
- Masks errors
- Creates false confidence
- Corrupts measurements
- Delays discovery

**Recommendation:** **ELIMINATE ALL `|| true` on critical paths**

### Tertiary Issue: Validation Gaps

**Status:** 🟡 **PARTIAL FIX AVAILABLE**

Doctor scripts exist but:
- Not automated
- Not enforced
- Not comprehensive enough

**Recommendation:** **AUTOMATE AND ENFORCE**

### Quaternary Issue: Escape Hatch Absence

**Status:** 🔴 **CRITICAL GAP**

No emergency fallback when sidecar fails:
- No simple recovery
- No bypass mode
- No clear documentation

**Recommendation:** **ADD FALLBACK MODE**

### Underlying Issue: Complexity Debt

**Status:** 🔴 **SYSTEMIC**

The project accumulated complexity:
- 40+ hardcoded paths
- Multiple workspaces
- Junction dependencies
- Windows-specific workarounds
- **All to avoid Windows Defender slowness**

**Recommendation:** **SIMPLIFY OR CONTAINERIZE**

---

## The Verdict

**You were absolutely right:** The sidecar was the tipping point.

**But more importantly:** It revealed a pattern of complexity accumulation without corresponding robustness investment.

The sidecar didn't fail suddenly. It failed gradually, silently, invisibly - a perfect example of technical debt compounding until the interest payment (2.5 hours of wasted Session 7 work) exceeds the principal (Windows Defender slowdown).

**The real structural issue:** A culture of adding complexity (sidecar) without adding validation (comprehensive doctor, fail-loud patterns, escape hatches).

**The path forward:** Either remove the sidecar (simplicity) or harden it completely (robustness) - but the current middle ground is unsustainable.

**Confidence:** HIGH (based on git history, code inspection, and external validation)
**Next Action:** Decision - Repair sidecar or remove it?
