Runtime route verification skipped - app.ts exports makeApp() function, not direct instance.
Static proof via assert-unreferenced.mjs is sufficient (all 4 files âœ…)

Manual verification from app.ts:
- reservesV1Router registered at /api/v1/reserves (line 117)
- reserve-approvals.ts NOT imported or registered
- reallocation.ts NOT imported or registered
