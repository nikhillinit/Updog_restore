### Added

#### Phase 2 - Agent-Core Optimization (In Progress)

**Phase 2 - Issue #1: Worker Thread Serialization** âœ… COMPLETE
- Fixed critical async serialization flaw (was fake async, still blocked event loop)
- Implemented Piscina worker thread pool for true async serialization
- Small objects (< 1KB): Fast synchronous path
- Large objects (â‰¥ 1KB): Offload to worker thread
- Performance: Event loop blocking 100-500ms â†’ 0-5ms
- Comprehensive test suite (25+ test cases)
- See: [packages/agent-core/PHASE2_ISSUE1_COMPLETION.md](packages/agent-core/PHASE2_ISSUE1_COMPLETION.md)

**Phase 2 - Issue #2: Redis L2 Cache** ðŸš§ Day 1/3 Complete
- Created cache infrastructure foundation for serverless (Vercel) compatibility
- CacheAdapter interface for pluggable backends (Upstash/ioredis/in-memory)
- UpstashAdapter: HTTP Redis client optimized for Vercel serverless
  - MessagePack serialization (30-50% smaller payload)
  - gzip compression for objects > 2KB
  - Circuit breaker fault tolerance (trip after 5 failures, 2min recovery)
  - 25ms operation timeout with graceful degradation
  - 128KB payload size limit
- KeySchema: Versioned keys (`v1`) with tag-based bulk invalidation
- CircuitBreaker: Automatic failure detection and recovery (CLOSED â†’ OPEN â†’ HALF_OPEN)
- Status: Foundation complete (1,368 LOC), integration pending (Day 2-3)
- Next: ConversationCache integration with Stale-While-Revalidate pattern
- See: [packages/agent-core/PHASE2_ISSUE2_DETAILED_PLAN.md](packages/agent-core/PHASE2_ISSUE2_DETAILED_PLAN.md)

**Multi-AI Review Results**:
- 3 AI models (GPT-4, Gemini, DeepSeek) reviewed Phase 1 implementation
- Average Score: 7.3/10, Confidence: 73%
- Verdict: Conditional GO (fix 5 P0 issues before production)
- All critical issues being addressed in Phase 2
- See: [packages/agent-core/reviews/MULTI_AI_CONSENSUS_REPORT.md](packages/agent-core/reviews/MULTI_AI_CONSENSUS_REPORT.md)

### Changed
- **Development Dependencies Updated** - Merged Dependabot PR with 7 package updates
  - `@playwright/test` 1.55.1 â†’ 1.56.0 - Added Playwright Agents for LLM-guided test creation
  - `@redocly/cli` 2.3.0 â†’ 2.3.1 - JSONPath bug fixes for API documentation
  - `@replit/vite-plugin-cartographer` 0.2.8 â†’ 0.3.1 - Vite plugin improvements

- **Sidecar Architecture Enhanced** - Added testing libraries to Windows sidecar workspace
  - Added `jsdom`, `@testing-library/jest-dom`, `@testing-library/react`, `@testing-library/user-event`
  - Ensures Vitest running from tools_local can find all test dependencies
  - Updated tools_local to match Vite 5.4.20 and tsx 4.20.6 versions

### Added
- **Conversation Memory System** - Multi-turn conversation persistence for cross-agent workflows
  - Thread-based conversations with UUID tracking and parent/child chains
  - Cross-tool continuation (analyzer â†’ fixer â†’ validator with full context)
  - File/image context preservation with newest-first prioritization strategy
  - Token-aware history building with intelligent truncation (newest turns prioritized)
  - Storage backend abstraction (in-memory for dev, Redis for production)
  - Integrated into `BaseAgent` with `enableConversationMemory` config flag
  - Architecture inspired by [zen-mcp-server](https://github.com/BeehiveInnovations/zen-mcp-server)
  - [Demo](packages/agent-core/demo-conversation-memory.ts) showing multi-agent workflow
  - Comprehensive test suite with 50+ test cases covering all scenarios

### Added (Previous)
- **Production-Grade Fund Modeling Schemas** - Complete TypeScript/Zod schema system for VC fund modeling
  - `StageProfile` - Replace hard-coded exit buckets with stage-driven valuations and deterministic cohort math
  - `FeeProfile` - Tiered management fee structure with 6 calculation bases, step-downs, and fee recycling
  - `CapitalCallPolicy` - Flexible capital call timing (upfront, periodic, as-needed, custom schedules)
  - `WaterfallPolicy` - European (fund-level) and American (deal-by-deal) distribution waterfalls with GP commit and clawback
  - `RecyclingPolicy` - Management fee and exit proceeds recycling with caps, terms, and timing control
  - `ExtendedFundModelInputs` - Complete fund model combining all policies with validation
  - [Documentation](docs/schemas/README.md) with examples and migration guide
  - [Example configurations](shared/schemas/examples/standard-fund.ts) for early-stage, micro-VC, and growth funds

### Technical Improvements
- **Decimal.js Integration** - All financial calculations use 30-digit precision decimals
- **Fractional Company Counts** - Support for fractional counts (e.g., 25.5 companies) to eliminate rounding errors
- **Deterministic Cohort Math** - Stage progression uses expected values to preserve mass balance
- **Discriminated Unions** - Type-safe policy variants with Zod validation
- **Helper Functions** - Calculation utilities for fees, capital calls, waterfalls, and recycling
- **Comprehensive Validation** - Cross-field validation (e.g., graduation + exit â‰¤ 100%)

### Documentation
- Added complete schema system documentation with API reference
- Included migration guide from MVP hard-coded values to schema-based configuration
- Created standard, micro-VC, and growth fund example configurations
- Documented deterministic cohort math rationale
