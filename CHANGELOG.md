## [2025-01-23] - Stage B: Test-Repair Agent

### Added - Automated Test Repair System
- **TestRepairAgent Class**: AI agent for automated test failure detection and repair
- **Core Logic**: ~30 lines of focused repair algorithms as specified
- **Failure Classification**: Categorizes failures as syntax, assertion, runtime, or timeout
- **Intelligent Repairs**: Targeted fix generation based on failure patterns
- **Draft PR Creation**: Automated branch creation and GitHub PR submission
- **CLI Integration**: `npm run ai repair` command with pattern matching and options

- **Repair Strategies**: Pattern-based fixes for common test failure types
- **GitHub Integration**: Automated PR creation using GitHub CLI (`gh`)
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive retry logic and structured error reporting

### CLI Commands Added
- `npm run ai repair` - Repair all failing tests
- `npm run ai repair [pattern]` - Repair tests matching pattern
- `npm run ai repair --draft-pr` - Create draft PR with repairs
- `npm run ai repair --max-repairs=N` - Limit number of repairs
- `npm run ai repair --verbose` - Detailed operation logging

### Documentation
- **README**: Comprehensive usage guide and API documentation
- **Examples**: Working examples demonstrating agent functionality
- **Integration Guide**: CLI usage patterns and configuration options

### Failure Classification System
- **Syntax Errors**: Missing semicolons, unexpected tokens
- **Assertion Failures**: Expected vs received value mismatches
- **Runtime Errors**: Null references, function not found
- **Timeout Issues**: Slow async operations, infinite loops

## [2025-01-23] - Stage C: Observability Stack

### Added - Complete Monitoring and Alerting System
- **Prometheus Integration**: MetricsCollector class with comprehensive agent metrics collection
- **Grafana Dashboard**: Real-time agent performance visualization with success rates and duration tracking
- **Slack Alerting**: Real-time crash notifications with severity levels and contextual information
- **Health Monitoring**: HealthMonitor class for agent status tracking and degradation detection
- **Docker Stack**: Complete observability infrastructure with Prometheus, Grafana, AlertManager

### Technical Implementation
- **MetricsCollector**: Prometheus metrics with execution tracking, failure rates, and performance data
- **SlackNotifier**: Configurable alert system with crash, failure, and recovery notifications
- **HealthMonitor**: Automatic agent status tracking with cooldown periods and alert management
- **Metrics Server**: Express server with `/metrics` and `/health` endpoints for monitoring
- **Alert Rules**: Comprehensive Prometheus alerts for agent failures, performance issues, and system health

### Observability Features
- **Agent Metrics**: Execution count, duration histograms, failure rates, retry tracking, active agent count
- **System Monitoring**: CPU, memory, disk usage via node-exporter integration
- **Real-time Dashboards**: Agent overview, performance trends, health status, failure analysis
- **Proactive Alerts**: High failure rates, long execution times, agent downtime, system resource issues
- **Slack Integration**: Immediate notifications for critical issues with structured context

### Infrastructure Components
- **Prometheus**: Metrics collection with 15-second scrape intervals and 200-hour retention
- **Grafana**: Pre-configured dashboards with agent performance visualization and alerting thresholds
- **AlertManager**: Alert routing with Slack integration and inhibition rules
- **Node Exporter**: System metrics collection for comprehensive monitoring

### CLI Enhancements
- `npm run ai metrics` - Display observability endpoints and setup instructions
- `npm run ai:metrics` - Start dedicated metrics server
- `docker-compose -f docker-compose.observability.yml up -d` - Launch complete monitoring stack

### Alert Configuration
