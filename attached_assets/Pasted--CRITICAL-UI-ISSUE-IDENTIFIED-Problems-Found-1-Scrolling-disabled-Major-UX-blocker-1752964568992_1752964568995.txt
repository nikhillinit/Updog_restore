  üîß IMMEDIATE REPLIT FIX COMMAND

  You are fixing critical UI issues in the     
   fund setup page.

  URGENT FIXES REQUIRED:

  1. **FIX SCROLLING IMMEDIATELY**
     - Use Read tool on
  client/src/pages/fund-setup.tsx
     - Check for CSS overflow:hidden,
  height:100vh, or fixed positioning
     - Remove any CSS that prevents
  scrolling
     - Ensure page content is scrollable       
  on all screen sizes

  2. **IMPLEMENT TACTYC WIZARD FLOW**
     - Convert single long form to
  step-by-step wizard
     - Step 1: Basic fund info (name,
  currency, dates, capital)
     - Progress indicator showing current      
  step
     - Next/Previous navigation between        
  steps
     - Save progress between steps

  3. **BALANCE COMPLETENESS WITH 
  USABILITY**
     - Required fields marked clearly with     
   asterisks
     - Optional fields can be skipped
  initially
     - Validation on step completion, not      
  form submission
     - Allow partial progress saving

  4. **RESPONSIVE DESIGN**
     - Test scrolling on
  mobile/tablet/desktop
     - Ensure all content accessible
     - Proper viewport sizing
     - No fixed height containers

  5. **PROGRESSIVE DISCLOSURE**
     - Show essential fields first
     - Advanced options in later steps or      
  expandable sections
     - Clear "Skip for now" options for        
  non-critical fields
     - Completion progress tracking

  IMMEDIATE CSS CHECKS:
  - Remove height: 100vh if present
  - Remove overflow: hidden
  - Check for position: fixed issues
  - Ensure proper container sizing

  DO NOT explain. FIX scrolling and
  implement step-by-step wizard
  immediately.
