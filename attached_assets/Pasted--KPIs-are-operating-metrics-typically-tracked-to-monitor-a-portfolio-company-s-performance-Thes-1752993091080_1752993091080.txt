## **How to add a KPI to an investment?**

1. Go **KPI Manager** from the sidebar
2. Select the portfolio company, you’d like to track KPIs for and click on **Add KPI**. Select from a list of pre-defined KPIs or create your own KPI metric using the **New Metric** option
3. For each KPI, you can specify:
   * whether the KPI is quantitative or qualitative
   * the tracking frequency (how often you expect to track this KPI)
   * tracking period (range over which you expect to track the KPI)
   * KPI data format (currency, percentage etc.)
   * Description (a quick description of this KPI)
   * Company Comments (qualitative comments or MD\&A)
   * whether you would like the company to upload documents related to this KPI

You can add KPI data yourself, or if you are on an Enterprise Plan, you can also request portfolio companies to enter their KPI data themselves.

To add a KPI data yourself:

* Go to **KPI Manager > Manage KPIs > Select Company > Add KPI**
* Enter data directly in the grid
* Click **Save**

## **Request KPIs from portfolio companies**

{% hint style="info" %}
The ability to request KPIs from portfolio companies is available on our Enterprise Plans only. Contact us at [support@tactyc.io](mailto:support@tactyc.io) to get access to this feature.
{% endhint %}

Tactyc lets you create web forms that can be sent to portfolio companies requesting them to directly update their KPI data. These one-time web forms are unique to each portfolio company and can be password protected. The portfolio company does not need a Tactyc account or a Tactyc login.

#### Assigning a company contact

1. Go to **KPI Manager** > **KPI Requests** > **Contacts**
2. Enter an email address for the company. You can also use the **Import** function to import contacts from an Excel spreadsheet.

3. Once completed, they will click on **Submit** at the bottom of the page to finish the update

#### **Once a request has been submitted**

2. Once logged in, you will see the request status has now changed from **Pending Status** _to_ **Pending Review**
