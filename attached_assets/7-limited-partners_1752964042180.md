# Limited Partners - Construction Wizard

**This is an optional section. If left unfilled, the forecasted model will summarize LP returns as a single LP entity. If you've defined LP's in this section, the model can forecast returns for each LP**

## Adding LPs

To add a Limited Partner, click on **Add a Limited Partner**

- Enter the **LP Investment Amount**
- Enter the expected **Capital Schedule** for each LP
- Under **Fee Profile** drop-down select the appropriate fee profile for each LP
- Set either a custom profit split or let Tactyc assign returns on a pro-rata basis (pro-rata is calculated based on each LP's contribution)

You may also use the **Bulk Upload** option to fill an Excel template and upload your LP data

## Customizing Profit Splits by LP

- By default, Tactyc will always distribute profits to all LP's based on their **pro-rata** share of committed capital

- However this method can be overridden, by selecting **Toggle Profit Splits** from the top toolbar and then selecting **Custom** option from the Profit Split (%) for each LP. You can then adjust the percentage of profits each LP can earn from the different tiers:

  - **Tier 1 profit split** (this is the initial investment return)
  - **Tier 2 profit split** (this is the preferred hurdle return profit split. Only activated if the waterfall actually has a hurdle rate provision)
  - **Tier 4 profit split** (this is the profit split after GP carried interest)
