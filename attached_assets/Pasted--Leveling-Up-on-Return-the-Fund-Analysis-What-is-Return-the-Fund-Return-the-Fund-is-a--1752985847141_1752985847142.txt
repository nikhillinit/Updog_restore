# Leveling Up on Return the Fund Analysis

**What is Return the Fund?**

_Return the Fund_ is a common analysis managers undertake when evaluating venture deals. This involves calculating a _Return the Fund_ metric i.e. the aggregate valuation a company needs to achieve in order to pay back the entire fund. A “Fund Returner” is a single deal that achieves this threshold — and while rare, deals like these are critical given the Power Law nature in VC.

Tactyc automatically calculates and presents _Return the Fund_ in different contexts to answer various questions for the manager.

**For Portfolio Construction**

When constructing a fund, Tactyc shows the _Return the Fund_ for each allocation and how that changes over subsequent rounds (shown in the _Rounds_ section of your fund’s dashboard).

As the fund’s ownership dilutes over subsequent rounds, _Return the Fund_ increases — and this can be helpful in setting future reserves to keep this metric in check.

**Beyond Construction**\
Similarly, for active portfolio companies, Tactyc automatically calculates the _Return the Fund_ at each forecasted round. Simply select a specific investment’s performance case to view the _Return the Fund_ profile.

**For Determining Reserves**

When setting reserves for a future round, Tactyc automatically shows how _Return the Fund_ changes at different reserve levels. As reserves increase, _Return the Fund_ decreases and thus a manager can use this as a guide to optimize their reserve for a particular deal.
