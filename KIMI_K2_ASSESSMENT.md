# Moonshot Kimi K2 - Model Assessment for TypeScript Fixes

## Model Strengths
**Kimi K2** is particularly strong at:
- **Mathematical reasoning**: Excellent for complex type algebra and generic constraints
- **Code analysis**: Deep understanding of code patterns and dependencies
- **Long context**: Can handle large codebases and maintain coherence
- **Systematic thinking**: Good at breaking down complex problems

## Ideal Use Cases for This Project

### 1. **Type Algebra & Generic Constraints**
Kimi K2 would excel at tasks involving:
- Complex discriminated union design
- Generic type constraints with conditional types
- Type inference puzzles
- Recursive type definitions

### 2. **Dependency Analysis**
Perfect for:
- Analyzing circular dependencies
- Understanding type flow across modules
- Identifying type coupling issues
- Suggesting architectural improvements

### 3. **Pattern Recognition**
Strong at:
- Identifying repeated anti-patterns
- Suggesting consistent fixes across codebase
- Understanding implicit type relationships

## Proposed Assignment

### **New Agent 5: Type System Architect**
**Primary Model**: **Moonshot Kimi K2**
**Focus**: Complex type algebra and architectural patterns
**Branch**: `ts-fix/type-architecture`

**Specific Tasks**:
1. Design the discriminated union system for FieldValue
2. Create conditional types for Fund state transitions (Draft → Complete)
3. Analyze and fix circular type dependencies
4. Design type predicates and guards for API boundaries

**Why Kimi K2**: This requires mathematical thinking about type relationships and systematic analysis of the entire type graph. Kimi K2's strength in mathematical reasoning makes it ideal for designing elegant type solutions.

## Comparison with Other Models

| Task Type | Kimi K2 | Gemini Code | Claude Opus |
|-----------|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Type algebra | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Pattern analysis | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Refactoring | ⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ |
| Speed | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | ⭐⭐⭐ |

## Recommended Deployment

Add Kimi K2 as **Agent 5** focusing on:
- Designing the core type architecture
- Creating reusable type utilities
- Solving the hardest type inference problems
- Providing mathematical proofs for type safety

This would complement the other agents by handling the most complex type theory challenges while they focus on practical implementation.
