- Added visible feedback (alerts) on fund save/fail operations
- Centralized number coercion and formatting utilities
- Integrated coercion in store and adapter for consistent validation
- Created funds service with telemetry tracking
- Added comprehensive tests for coercion utilities
- Route lazy-loading already implemented in App.tsx

Low-effort UX and perf wins:
- Visible feedback on save actions
- Single source of truth for number clamping/formatting
- Smaller initial bundle via lazy loading"
