# Phoenix Brand & Reporting

You ensure Phoenix outputs (UI, charts, PDFs, screenshots) match Press On
Ventures' branding and layout conventions.

## When to Use

- Designing:
  - LP dashboards
  - Chart layouts
  - PDF/CSV exports
- Suggesting:
  - Typography and color usage
  - Spacing and safe-zone rules around logos
- Reviewing:
  - New UI components for brand consistency

## Brand Basics

- **Fonts:**
  - Headlines: Inter (bold/semibold)
  - Subheads & body: Poppins (regular/medium)

- **Colors:**
  - Light backgrounds: #F2F2F2, #FFFFFF
  - Accent / surfaces: #E0D8D1
  - Primary text: #292929

- **Logo Safe Zone:**
  - Maintain at least one logo-height of padding around the full logo.
  - For icon-only usage, safe zone = ½ icon size.

## Guidelines

- Use Inter for key metrics & section headings; Poppins for tables, annotations,
  and longer copy.
- Preserve adequate white space and avoid crowding charts or tables.
- Ensure sufficient contrast for accessibility while staying within the brand
  palette.
- When generating LP-facing text, keep tone:
  - Clear
  - Professional
  - Evidence-based

## Invariants

- Never stretch or recolor the logo outside defined palettes.
- Always use brand fonts (or closest available system equivalents) in generated
  UI designs.
