## 🎛️ Adaptive Parameters

The system automatically adjusts parameters based on problem complexity:

### Complexity Detection

```typescript
function determineComplexity(problem: string): 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'very high' {
  const factors = {
    length: problem.length,
    technicalTerms: countTechnicalTerms(problem),
    stakeholders: countStakeholders(problem),
    constraints: countConstraints(problem)
  };

  // Auto-select workflow parameters based on complexity
  if (factors.length > 1000 && factors.technicalTerms > 10) return 'very high';
  if (factors.length > 500 || factors.stakeholders > 3) return 'high';
  if (factors.length > 200 || factors.constraints > 2) return 'medium';
  return 'low';
}
```

### Recommended Configurations

| Complexity | Agents | Rounds | Iteration | Estimated Time |
|------------|--------|--------|-----------|----------------|
| **Low** | 2-3 | 2 | 3 | 30-60s |
| **Medium** | 3-4 | 3 | 4 | 60-120s |
| **High** | 4-5 | 3-4 | 5 | 120-180s |
| **Very High** | 5+ | 4-5 | 7 | 180-300s |

      "perspective": "Identify and mitigate security risks"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Refinement Config

## 🛠️ Advanced Features

### 1. **Parallel Execution**

All agents run in parallel for faster results:

```typescript
const results = await Promise.allSettled(
  agents.map(agent => agent.analyze(problem))
);
```

### 2. **Confidence Scoring**

Each agent provides confidence levels (0-100%):

```json
{
  "agent": "architect",
  "confidence": 92,
  "reasoning": "..."
}
```

### 3. **Dissent Tracking**

Minority opinions are preserved:

```json
{
  "dissent": [
    {
      "agent": "DevOps",
      "opinion": "Consider managed service to reduce ops burden",
      "reasoning": "Team is small, self-hosting adds risk"
    }
  ]
}
```

### 4. **Iterative Improvement**

Track improvement across rounds:

```json
{
  "metrics": {
    "improvementRate": 30.0,  // 30% improvement from Round 1 to Round 5
    "consensusReached": true
  }
}
```

---

## 🚨 Error Handling

All endpoints include comprehensive error handling:

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": "Analysis failed",
  "details": {
    "phase": "round2",
    "agent": "architect",
    "reason": "API rate limit exceeded"
  }
}
```

---

## 📚 Next Steps

### Recommended Workflow:

1. **Start Simple**: Try `code-review` on a recent PR
2. **Explore Complexity**: Run `adr` for a pending decision
3. **Go Deep**: Use `refine` for a novel problem
4. **Analyze Strategy**: Run full `strategy/analyze` on your CI/CD plan

### Integration Ideas:

- **GitHub Actions**: Auto-run code review on PRs
- **Slack Bot**: `/consensus adr <topic>` command
- **CLI Tool**: `consensus refine "problem statement"`
- **VS Code Extension**: Right-click → "Get AI Consensus"
