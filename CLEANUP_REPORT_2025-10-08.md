**Commits:**
- `cd2dddf` - "docs: archive sprint-g2c planning documents"

## Phase 4: Code Cleanup ‚úÖ

### Deprecated Functions Removed (2 functions, 19 lines)

**File:** `client/src/lib/excel-parity-validator.ts`

**Removed:**
- `toCompany()` - marked @deprecated, **0 usages** found
- `toStagePolicy()` - marked @deprecated, **0 usages** found

**Replaced with:** `toEngineCompany()` and `toEngineStagePolicy()` (already in use)

**Kept (still in use):**
- `committedFeeDragPctFromTiers()` in `client/src/lib/fees.ts` - has active callers + tests
- `isSentryEnabled()` in `client/src/lib/sentry.ts` - backward compatibility wrapper

**Commits:**
- `9c5c168` - "refactor: remove unused deprecated functions"

## Remaining Recommendations

### üîç **PRs Requiring Investigation**

| PR # | Title | Status | Recommendation |
|------|-------|--------|----------------|
| #22 | ESLint autofix | 123K additions, draft | Check with author or close if abandoned |
| #51 | Memory mode polish | 346 files, 10K additions | Extract missing pieces to new PRs, then close |
| #65 | Property-based tests | Valuable work | **KEEP** - Rebase and merge! |
| #130 | Fix quarantine tests | Active WIP (Oct 7) | **KEEP** - Monitor for completion |

### üìä **Future Optimization Opportunities**

1. **Workflow Consolidation** - 50 workflow files identified:
   - Multiple CI files: `ci-optimized.yml`, `ci-unified.yml`, `ci-memory.yml`, `ci-reserves-v11.yml`
   - Multiple guardian files: `guardian.yml`, `guardian-complete.yml`, `guardian-ttl-mute.yml`
   - Multiple scoreboard files: `green-scoreboard.yml`, `green-scoreboard-complete.yml`
   - Multiple synthetic files: `synthetic.yml`, `synthetics-5m.yml`, `synthetics-e2e.yml`, `synthetics-smart.yml`

2. **Merged Branch Cleanup** - 13 branches already merged to main can be safely deleted

3. **Additional Deprecated Code** - Monitor for removal when replacements stabilize:
   - `committedFeeDragPctFromTiers()` - when `committedFeeDragFraction()` fully adopted
   - `isSentryEnabled()` - when all callers migrate to `@/monitoring`

## Lessons Learned

1. **AI Agent Consensus** - Using the general-purpose agent to validate cleanup decisions provided high-confidence recommendations backed by evidence
2. **Feature Duplication** - Many old PRs represented work that was implemented incrementally in main branch over time
3. **Bot PR Proliferation** - Copilot/Dependabot create many PRs; need regular cleanup cadence
4. **Documentation Drift** - Sprint planning docs should be archived immediately after sprint completion

---

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Completed:** Push cleanup commits to remote branch
2. üìã **Recommended:** Investigate PRs #22, #51 (2-3 weeks)
3. üîÑ **Recommended:** Rebase and merge PR #65 (property-based tests)
4. üóëÔ∏è **Future:** Delete 13 merged branches
5. üîß **Future:** Consolidate duplicate workflow files (15-20 workflows)
