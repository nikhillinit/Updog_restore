## 🔍 Key Findings

### Common Issue: Branch Contamination

All three original PRs were created from `remediation/week2-server-strictness`
instead of `main`, bundling unrelated TypeScript strictness work (617→100
errors, 100+ commits).

### Root Cause

```
remediation/week2-server-strictness (base branch)
  ├── feat/deterministic-analytics (PR #157) ❌
  ├── feat/ai-security-audit (PR #158) ❌
  └── feat/excel-parity-testing (PR #159) ❌

Should have been:
main (base branch)
  ├── feat/deterministic-analytics-clean (PR #160) ✅
  ├── feat/ai-security-audit (needs cleanup) ⚠️
  └── feat/excel-parity-clean (future) 🔜
```

### Solution Applied

Created clean branches by:

1. `git checkout main`
2. `git checkout -b feat/[feature]-clean`
3. `git cherry-pick [specific commits]`
4. Verify only relevant files changed
