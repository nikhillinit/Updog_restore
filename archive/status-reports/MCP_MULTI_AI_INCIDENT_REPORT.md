# Multi-AI MCP Server - Complete Incident Report

**Report Date:** October 5, 2025 **Incident Timeline:** October 4-5, 2025
**Status:** ⚠️ DISABLED - Security review ongoing **Classification:** Supply
Chain Security Vulnerability

---

## Executive Summary

The `multi-ai-collab` MCP server was installed, used extensively for parallel
multi-AI development workflows, then disabled due to security concerns. This
report documents the complete timeline, behavioral inconsistencies, security
issues, and current status.

### Key Findings

1. **Auto-registration vulnerability** - MCP server auto-loaded from external
   directory
2. **Behavioral inconsistencies** - Multiple enable/disable cycles without clear
   documentation
3. **Supply chain risk** - Code outside repository, unaudited, no integrity
   verification
4. **Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU) problem** - No cryptographic verification of
   server identity
5. **Privilege escalation risk** - MCP servers run with full user permissions

```markdown
**Date:** October 5, 2025 **Execution Mode:** Parallel multi-agent workflow
**Agents Deployed:** 6 specialized agents **Status:** ✅ All tasks completed
successfully
```

**6 Parallel Agents Deployed:**

1. **CSV/XLSX Security Agent** (Gemini)
   - Hardened `client/src/utils/exporters.ts`
   - Added control character bypass detection

   - Proposed hardened deny rules

3. **Lighthouse CI Agent** (Gemini)
   - Created `.lighthouserc.json`
   - Implemented HTTP polling architecture
   - Added performance budgets

4. **Bundle Analysis Agent** (OpenAI)
   - Integrated `rollup-plugin-visualizer`
   - Added `npm run analyze` script
   - Preserved existing chunk strategy

5. **Property Testing Agent** (DeepSeek)
   - Created 338-line property test suite
   - Documented 5 core invariants
   - Implemented 350+ test cases

6. **Sentry Update Agent** (Gemini)

   - Updated to modern `@sentry/react` API

**Execution Metrics:**

- **Total lines delivered:** 744 lines
- **Files created:** 4
- **Files modified:** 5
- **Files deleted:** 1
- **Execution time:** ~2-3 minutes (vs. 15-20 sequential)
- **Success rate:** 100% (6/6)

#### 3. Multi-AI Validated Features

**Evidence from commit messages:**

- `368dece` - "feat: complete demo implementation - scenario save/compare with
  **multi-AI validation**"
- `b5cb36b` - "feat: feature flag UI infrastructure - **multi-AI validated**"
- `94cc833` - "docs: optimal build strategy with **multi-AI consensus**"
- `a7edcee` - "docs: **multi-AI validated** feature completion strategy"

---

### October 5, 2025 - Security Concerns Identified

**Commit:** `100b5ac` - "docs(security): add comprehensive security review
documentation"

#### Files Created

**`.mcp.json.SECURITY_REVIEW`** - Critical security assessment

```markdown
## ⚠️ SECURITY CONCERNS - .mcp.json

### Risk Assessment: **HIGH**

This creates a **supply chain security vulnerability**
```

#### Configuration Change

**`.claude/settings.local.json`** - MCP server disabled

```json
{
  "enableAllProjectMcpServers": false // ← DISABLED
}
```

---

## Behavioral Inconsistencies

### Issue #1: Unclear Enable/Disable State

**Problem:** Git history shows **37 commits** modifying
`.claude/settings.local.json` but **no explicit mentions** of enabling/disabling
MCP servers in commit messages.

**Evidence:**

- No commits say "enable MCP server"
- No commits say "disable MCP server" until `100b5ac`
- Only the final security review commit mentions the setting

**Questions:**

1. When was `enableAllProjectMcpServers` first set to `true`?
2. How many times was it toggled?
3. What triggered each toggle?

### Issue #2: Installation vs. Repository Integration

**Installed Location:**

```
%AppData%\Claude\Claude Extensions\multi-ai-collab\
```

**Repository Evidence:**

```
claude_code-multi-AI-MCP/
├── manifest.json
├── install-to-claude.ps1
└── (source files NOT in repo)
```

**Problem:** The actual MCP server code (`server.py`, `ai_clients.py`, etc.) is
**not in the repository**. Only the installer and manifest are tracked.

**Implication:** Cannot audit the code that was actually executed.

### Issue #3: Undocumented Multi-AI Workflows

**Commit messages reference multi-AI work:**

- "multi-AI validation"
- "multi-AI consensus"
- "multi-AI validated"

**But no documentation exists for:**

- How to invoke multi-AI tools
- Which AI model was used for which task
- How consensus was achieved
- What happens when AIs disagree

**Evidence gap:** `PARALLEL_EXECUTION_SUMMARY.md` documents **outcomes** but not
**invocation methods**.

### Issue #4: Credential Management Unclear

**manifest.json references:**

```json
"credentials.json" // Contains API keys
```

**Questions:**

1. Where is this file?
2. What API keys were used?
3. Who provided them?
4. Are they still active?
5. Could they be compromised?

### Issue #5: Auto-Registration Without Explicit Consent

**manifest.json configuration:**

```json
{
  "mcp_config": {
    "command": "C:\\Python313\\python.exe",
    "args": ["${__dirname}\\server.py"],
    "env": {}
  }
}
```

**Problem:** Once installed via PowerShell script, the MCP server
**auto-registers** with Claude Code. No per-session consent, no cryptographic
verification.

---

## Security Analysis

### High-Risk Factors

#### 1. Code Outside Repository ⚠️ CRITICAL

**Risk:** The actual MCP server code lives at:

```
C:\Users\%USERNAME%\AppData\Roaming\Claude\Claude Extensions\multi-ai-collab\
```

**Cannot be audited because:**

- Not tracked in version control
- Not reviewed in pull requests
- Could be modified outside Git workflow
- No integrity checksums

**Attack vector:** Malicious update to external code could compromise entire
system.

#### 2. Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU) ⚠️ HIGH

**Problem:** No cryptographic verification of:

- Server identity
- Code integrity
- Update authenticity

**Attack vector:** Man-in-the-middle during installation could inject malicious
code.

#### 3. Privilege Escalation ⚠️ HIGH

**Current permissions:** MCP servers run with full user privileges.

**Capabilities:**

- Read any file user can read
- Write any file user can write
- Execute arbitrary commands
- Access environment variables (including secrets)

**Attack vector:** Compromised MCP server has same access as user.

#### 4. API Key Exposure ⚠️ MEDIUM

**credentials.json contains:**

- Gemini API key
- OpenAI API key
- DeepSeek API key
- Grok API key (optional)

**Risks:**

- Keys stored in plaintext
- No key rotation mechanism
- Shared across all invocations
- Could be exfiltrated by malicious code

#### 5. No Audit Trail ⚠️ MEDIUM

**Missing:**

- Logs of which AI was called when
- Input/output records
- Cost tracking
- Rate limiting

**Impact:** Cannot reconstruct what happened or detect abuse.

---

## Evidence of Effectiveness

### Positive Outcomes (While Enabled)

Despite security concerns, the multi-AI MCP server **did deliver value**:

#### 1. Security Review Quality

**Before multi-AI:**

- Single AI (Claude) could miss edge cases
- No cross-validation of recommendations

**With multi-AI:**

- 3 AI models cross-validated findings
- Caught incorrect Sentry recommendation (Gemini)
- Found permission policy gaps (DeepSeek)
- Validated Lighthouse architecture (Gemini)

**Result:** Higher confidence in security decisions.

#### 2. Parallel Execution Speed

**Sequential approach:**

- 6 tasks × ~3 minutes each = ~18 minutes

**Parallel multi-AI:**

- 6 agents × concurrent = ~2-3 minutes

**Speedup:** ~6-9x faster development workflow.

#### 3. Code Quality Improvements

**744 lines of production-ready code delivered:**

- CSV/XLSX injection hardening
- Property-based testing framework (350+ test cases)
- Lighthouse CI integration
- Bundle analysis tooling
- Sentry modernization

**All code reviewed by multiple AI systems.**

#### 4. Specialized Expertise

**Model specialization observed:**

- **Gemini:** Architecture design, system analysis
- **OpenAI:** Best practices, clean code patterns
- **DeepSeek:** Security analysis, edge case detection

**Value:** Right AI for right task.

- [ ] Test in isolated environment
- [ ] Implement code signing verification
- [ ] Add audit logging

---

## Recommended Mitigation Strategy

### Short-term (If Re-enabling)

1. **Source Code Audit**

   ```bash
   # Clone the actual MCP server repo
   git clone https://github.com/RaiAnsar/claude_code-multi-AI-MCP

   # Review all Python source
   # - server.py
   # - ai_clients.py
   # - tool_definitions.py
   # - tool_handlers.py
   ```

2. **Integrity Verification**

   ```powershell
   # Generate SHA-256 hashes
   Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 *.py | Export-Csv hashes.csv

   # Store in repo for future verification
   ```

3. **Credential Isolation**

   ```json
   // Use separate API keys with rate limits
   {
     "gemini_api_key": "restricted-key-1",
     "openai_api_key": "restricted-key-2"
   }
   ```

4. **Audit Logging**

   ```typescript
   // Log all MCP tool calls
   interface MCPAuditLog {
     timestamp: string;
     tool: string;
     model: 'gemini' | 'openai' | 'deepseek';
     input_hash: string;
     cost_estimate: number;
   }
   ```

5. **Rate Limiting**
   ```typescript
   // Prevent API abuse
   const MCP_RATE_LIMITS = {
     calls_per_hour: 100,
     cost_per_day: 5.0, // USD
   };
   ```

### Long-term (Platform-level)

#### 1. Code Signing Requirement

```json
{
  "mcp_servers": {
    "require_signature": true,
    "trusted_signers": ["Anthropic Official", "Verified Developers"]
  }
}
```

#### 2. Permission Sandboxing

```json
{
  "multi-ai-collab": {
    "permissions": {
      "file_read": ["*.md", "*.ts", "*.tsx"],
      "file_write": [],
      "network": ["gemini-api.com", "openai.com"],
      "env_vars": ["GEMINI_API_KEY"]
    }
  }
}
```

#### 3. Explicit Approval Per Session

```

## Recommendations

### Immediate (Next 24 Hours)

1. **Audit Installed MCP Server**

   ```powershell
   # Examine what's actually installed
   cd "$env:APPDATA\Claude\Claude Extensions\multi-ai-collab"
   Get-ChildItem -Recurse
   Get-FileHash -Algorithm SHA256 *.py
   ```

2. **Review API Usage**
   - Check Gemini API dashboard for usage
   - Check OpenAI API dashboard for costs
   - Revoke and rotate keys if suspicious activity

3. **Document Decision**
   - Keep disabled permanently? Or re-enable after audit?
   - If re-enabling, what security controls are required?

### Short-term (This Week)

4. **Create MCP Vetting Policy**
   - Checklist for future MCP server installations
   - Security review template
   - Approval process

5. **Implement Audit Logging**
   - Log all MCP tool invocations
   - Track costs and rate limits
   - Alert on anomalies

6. **Version Control MCP Servers**
   - Add as git submodules
   - Pin to specific commits
   - Verify integrity on load

### Long-term (This Month)

7. **Request Platform Features from Anthropic**
   - Code signing for MCP servers
   - Permission sandboxing
   - Built-in audit logging
   - Per-session approval prompts

8. **Develop Alternative Approach**
   - Consider in-repo multi-AI orchestration
   - Use Claude's native tool-use API
   - Avoid external MCP dependencies

---

## Conclusion

The `multi-ai-collab` MCP server provided **significant value** through parallel
multi-AI workflows and cross-validation, but introduced **unacceptable supply
chain security risks**.

**Key Verdict:**

- ✅ **Functionality:** Excellent (6x speedup, higher quality)
- ❌ **Security:** Unacceptable (HIGH risk, no mitigations)
- ⚠️ **Documentation:** Good outcomes, poor process tracking

**Current State:** DISABLED pending security audit and policy development.

**Path Forward:** Re-enable only after:

1. Complete source code audit
2. Integrity verification system implemented
3. Audit logging in place
4. Permission sandboxing configured
5. Explicit user approval per session

**Alternative:** Develop in-repo multi-AI orchestration using Claude's native
APIs, avoiding external MCP dependencies entirely.
