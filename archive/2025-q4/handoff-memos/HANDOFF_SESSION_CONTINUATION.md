# Handoff Memo: Test Remediation Session Continuation

**Date:** 2025-10-19 **Session Duration:** ~2.5 hours **Status:** Module
Resolution Crisis RESOLVED ✅ | 154 Failures Remaining for Analysis

---

## Executive Summary

**Major Milestone Achieved:** Resolved critical module resolution crisis in 17
minutes using triple-AI validation (Gemini ultrathink + DeepSeek + Codex
consensus). Unlocked 586 previously-hidden tests and improved pass rate from 79%
→ 82%.

**Current State:**

- Total tests: 871 (was 285)
- Passing: 717 (82%)
- Failing: 154 (18%)
- **All configuration issues resolved** - test infrastructure is now stable

**Ready for Next Phase:** Analyze and remediate the 154 remaining test failures
(mix of pre-existing and newly discovered issues).

---

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### 1. Module Resolution Crisis ✅ (33 → 0 errors)

**Problem:** 33 "Cannot find package" errors blocking test execution for imports
like `@/lib/finance/xirr`, `@/core/reserves/ReserveEngine`, `@shared/schema`.

**Root Cause:** Vitest ≥1.0 `test.projects` don't inherit root-level
`resolve.alias` (expected behavior, not a bug).

**Solution Implemented:**

```typescript
// vitest.config.ts - Extracted shared alias constant
const alias = {
  '@/core': path.resolve(__dirname, './client/src/core'),
  '@/lib': path.resolve(__dirname, './client/src/lib'),
  '@/': path.resolve(__dirname, './client/src/'),
  '@shared': path.resolve(__dirname, './shared'),
  // ... full list in vitest.config.ts
};

// Added explicit resolve to both projects
projects: [
  {
    resolve: { alias }, // ← Server project
    test: { name: 'server', environment: 'node', ... }
  },
  {
    resolve: { alias }, // ← Client project
    test: { name: 'client', environment: 'jsdom', ... }
  }
]
```

**Validation Method:**

- Single file test first:
  `npx vitest --project server tests/unit/analytics-xirr.test.ts` ✅ PASSED
- Full server project: All resolution errors cleared
- Triple-validated by 3 independent AI analyses

**Impact:**

- Module resolution errors: 33 → 0
- Tests unlocked: 285 → 871 (+586 previously blocked)
- Pass rate: 79% → 82%

### 2. Schema Mock Data Starvation ✅ (NaN -78%)

**Problem:** 27 NaN cascade errors in Monte Carlo tests due to undefined mock
data.

**Solution:** Added 13 missing table mocks to
`tests/utils/mock-shared-schema.ts`:

- Portfolio construction: `reserveStrategies`, `pacingHistory`,
  `fundStrategyModels`
- Scenario modeling: `portfolioScenarios`, `reserveAllocationStrategies`
- Simulations: `scenarioComparisons`, `monteCarloSimulations`
- Decisions & audit: `reserveDecisions`, `reallocationAudit`
- Custom fields: `customFields`, `customFieldValues`
- Metadata: `auditLog`, `snapshotMetadata`

**Evidence:** `monte-carlo-2025-validation-core.test.ts` lines 188, 213, 239 now
receive valid data instead of `undefined → NaN` cascade.

**Impact:** NaN errors reduced from 27 → 6 (78% reduction)

### 3. Winston Dependency ✅

**Installed:** `winston@^3.x` for `server/utils/logger.ts`

### 4. Documentation ✅

**Updated:**

- `CHANGELOG.md` - Detailed session documentation with metrics
- `DECISIONS.md` - Added ADR-009 for Vitest path alias decision
- `TEST_PROGRESS.md` - Created session progress tracker
- `VALIDATION_RESULTS.md` - Created Option B validation evidence

**Commits Created:**

1. `c518c07` - feat(tests): Add 13 missing schema table mocks
2. `d2b7dc8` - fix(tests): Add explicit path aliases to vitest test projects +
   install winston
3. `dd65802` - docs(changelog): Document module resolution fix
4. `f094af1` - docs(decisions): Add ADR-009

### Metrics Comparison

| Metric        | Before Session | After Session | Change          |
| ------------- | -------------- | ------------- | --------------- |
| Total Tests   | 285            | 871           | +586 unlocked   |
| Passing       | 226 (79%)      | 717 (82%)     | +491, +3% rate  |
| Failing       | 45 (16%)       | 154 (18%)     | +109 discovered |
| Module Errors | 33             | 0             | -100% ✅        |
| NaN Errors    | 27             | 6             | -78% ✅         |

### Why Failures Increased (45 → 154)

**This is GOOD NEWS** - it's discovery, not regression:

**Before Config Fix:**

- 33 test files were completely blocked (couldn't load due to "Cannot find
  package")
- These files were counted as "failures" but couldn't report their actual test
  count
- 586 tests were hidden inside these blocked files

**After Config Fix:**

- ALL test files can now load and execute
- The 586 hidden tests are now running and reporting their true state
- Some pass (added to 717), some fail (added to 154)
- We now see the REAL test suite landscape

**Analogy:** We fixed a power outage - now we can see which lights actually need
new bulbs.

## The 154 Remaining Failures - Analysis Needed

### Known Pre-Existing Issues (from original 45)

1. **PRNG Seeding (~6 tests)** - HIGH PRIORITY
   - **Files:** `monte-carlo-2025-validation-core.test.ts`,
     `monte-carlo-power-law-validation.test.ts`
   - **Issue:** `PowerLawDistribution` not producing reproducible results with
     fixed seed
   - **Errors:** `expected NaN to be greater than...` (remaining 6 NaN errors)
   - **Root Cause:** Seed not propagating to internal PRNG correctly
   - **Location:** `server/services/power-law-distribution.ts`

2. **Request ID Middleware (~1-2 tests)** - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - **File:** `tests/unit/request-id.test.ts`
   - **Issue:** Server not overriding client-provided request IDs (security
     issue)
   - **Error:** `expected 'req_...' to be 'client-error-123'`
   - **Root Cause:** Middleware should ALWAYS generate new ID, not preserve
     client's
   - **Location:** `server/middleware/requestId.ts`

3. **Statistical Variance (~5 tests)** - LOW PRIORITY (may quarantine)
   - **File:** `monte-carlo-power-law-validation.test.ts`
   - **Issues:**
     - Series A Chasm inverted: `expected 139.25 to be greater than 587.92`
     - Portfolio failure rates too low: `expected 0.009 to be greater than 0.2`
     - Stage distribution sampling: `expected +0 to be close to 0.05`
   - **Possible Causes:** Flaky tests, wrong expectations, or non-deterministic
     RNG
   - **Action:** May need `@flaky` tag and quarantine

### Newly Discovered Issues (~140+ tests)

**Need to categorize these into:**

- Quick fixes (similar patterns to what we've done)
- Logic bugs requiring investigation
- Environment mismatches (Node vs jsdom)
- Schema/data issues
- Tests that may need skipping/quarantine

**Recommended Analysis Approach:**

1. Run tests with detailed output: `npm test 2>&1 > full-test-output.txt`
2. Categorize by error pattern (use grep/analysis)
3. Group by failure type:
   - Import/module errors (should be 0 now)
   - Assertion failures (logic bugs)
   - Timeout errors (async issues)
   - Type errors (TypeScript issues)
4. Prioritize by:
   - Blockers (prevent other tests from running)
   - Critical functionality (payment, security)
   - Quick wins (similar to fixes we've done)

---

## Key Decisions Made This Session

### ADR-009: Vitest Path Aliases Must Be Explicit in Projects

**Decision:** Use shared constant pattern for path aliases in test projects.

**Why:** Vitest ≥1.0 projects don't inherit root `resolve.alias` (by design).

**Rejected Alternatives:**

- File renaming (`.test.ts` → `.test.tsx`) - Would create technical debt
- Separate config files - Adds unnecessary complexity
- Living with module errors - Not viable

**Validation:** Triple-confirmed by Gemini + DeepSeek + Codex

**See:** `DECISIONS.md` ADR-009 for full rationale

### Option B Hybrid Approach: Validated ✅

**Approach:** Add missing mocks → validate incrementally → analyze results

**Results:**

- Mock additions worked (78% NaN reduction)
- Revealed module resolution as primary issue (not schema)
- Incremental validation prevented false starts

**Evidence:** `VALIDATION_RESULTS.md`

---

## Tools & Techniques Used

### Multi-AI Validation Process

1. **Gemini (Ultrathink)** - Deep analysis, rejected initial file-rename
   proposal
2. **DeepSeek** - Independent root cause analysis, recommended shared constant
3. **Codex** - Confirmed Vitest behavior, provided exact implementation pattern
4. **3 Explore Agents** - Gathered evidence (config structure, file existence,
   tsconfig alignment)

**Consensus:** 100% agreement on root cause and solution

### Incremental Validation

1. Single file test first:
   `npx vitest --project server tests/unit/analytics-xirr.test.ts`
2. Full server project: `npx vitest --project server`
3. Full suite: `npm test`

**Result:** Each step validated before proceeding to next

---

## Critical Context for Next Session

### What's Working ✅

- **Module resolution:** All path aliases working correctly
- **Test infrastructure:** Vitest config stable and documented
- **Schema mocks:** 47 tables covered in `mock-shared-schema.ts`
- **JSONB helpers:** Available in `tests/utils/jsonb-test-helper.ts`
- **Documentation:** Complete trail in CHANGELOG, DECISIONS, handoff docs

### What's NOT Working ⚠️

- **154 test failures** need analysis and categorization
- **PRNG seeding** still broken (6 NaN errors remain)
- **Request ID middleware** security issue unresolved
- **Statistical tests** may be flaky (need investigation)

### Don't Waste Time On ❌

- **Module resolution** - Already fixed, don't revisit
- **Missing table mocks** - Already added 13, coverage is good
- **File renaming** - Rejected approach, documented in ADR-009
- **Vitest config** - Working correctly, don't modify without reason

---

## Recommended Next Steps

### Immediate (Next Session Start)

1. **Analyze 154 Failures** (30-60 min)

   ```bash
   npm test 2>&1 | tee full-test-results.txt
   grep -E "FAIL|Error:" full-test-results.txt | sort | uniq -c
   ```

   - Categorize by error pattern
   - Group by root cause
   - Identify quick wins vs deep investigations

2. **Fix PRNG Seeding** (30-60 min) - HIGH PRIORITY
   - File: `server/services/power-law-distribution.ts`
   - Verify seed propagation in constructor
   - Test with: `npx vitest monte-carlo-2025-validation-core.test.ts`
   - Target: 6 NaN errors → 0

3. **Fix Request ID Middleware** (15-30 min) - MEDIUM PRIORITY
   - File: `server/middleware/requestId.ts`
   - Ensure server ALWAYS generates new ID
   - Test with: `npx vitest request-id.test.ts`
   - Target: 1-2 errors → 0

### Secondary (After Quick Wins)

4. **Review Statistical Variance Tests** (30-60 min)
   - File: `monte-carlo-power-law-validation.test.ts`
   - Determine if expectations are wrong or tests are flaky
   - Consider adding `@flaky` tag and quarantine
   - Target: 5 errors → 0 or quarantine

5. **Categorize Newly Discovered Failures** (~100+ tests)
   - Create spreadsheet or document
   - Group by error type and file
   - Assign priority (blocker/critical/medium/low)
   - Create remediation plan

### Long-term

6. **Consider Test Infrastructure Improvements**
   - Contract tests for schema (on-demand validation)
   - Automated mock generation
   - Better test isolation patterns

## Warnings & Gotchas

### Don't Break What's Working

1. **vitest.config.ts** - The shared alias constant pattern is working perfectly
   - DON'T change the `resolve: { alias }` pattern
   - DON'T remove the shared constant
   - DO add new aliases to the shared constant if needed

2. **mock-shared-schema.ts** - Schema mock coverage is good
   - 47 tables currently mocked (was 34, added 13)
   - DON'T delete existing mocks
   - DO use `createSharedSchemaMock()` in new tests

3. **Pre-commit hooks** - Working correctly
   - ESLint suppressions in mock-shared-schema.ts are necessary
   - DON'T remove `eslint-disable` comments without fixing the root issue

### Known Issues to Avoid

1. **Package.json has duplicate `test:ci` key** (line 136 and 260)
   - Causes build warning but doesn't break tests
   - Should be cleaned up but not urgent

2. **Some tests use old mock patterns**
   - Migration to centralized mocks is ongoing
   - New tests should use `createSharedSchemaMock()`

3. **Integration tests are excluded** (vitest.config.ts line 106)
   - Only unit tests are running currently
   - Integration tests need separate investigation

---

## Questions to Answer Next Session

1. **What are the 140+ newly discovered failures?**
   - Categorize by error type
   - Determine if they're real bugs or test issues
   - Prioritize by business impact

2. **Is PRNG seeding a simple fix or architectural issue?**
   - Check PowerLawDistribution constructor
   - Verify seed parameter handling
   - May need to refactor seeding strategy

3. **Are statistical variance tests actually flaky?**
   - Run multiple times with same seed
   - Check if expectations match current implementation
   - Consider if market conditions changed

4. **Should we increase test coverage or fix existing tests first?**
   - Current priority: Fix existing 154 failures
   - New coverage can wait until test suite is stable
