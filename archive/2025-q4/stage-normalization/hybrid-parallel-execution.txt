  What Was Delivered

  ✅ Phase 1 (Completed Previously)

  6 core infrastructure files with complete type safety and RFC compliance

  ✅ Phase 3: Database & Scripts (NEW - TODAY)

  1. Database Migration (migrations/20251030_stage_normalization_log.sql)
  - 79 lines of production-ready SQL
  - ENUM type for action validation
  - CHECK constraints on table_name and canonical stage values
  - Comprehensive indexes for query performance and duplicate prevention
  - Full documentation with rollback examples

  2. Backup Script (scripts/backup-stages.sh)
  - 110 lines with enterprise-grade error handling
  - Comprehensive validation (header checks, table presence, truncation detection)
  - Syslog audit logging for compliance
  - Silent-failure-hunter approved: zero silent failures

  3. Normalization Script (scripts/normalize-stages.ts)
  - 431 lines, production-ready
  - Single atomic transaction across both tables
  - Audit logging within transaction for atomicity
  - Fully parameterized SQL (zero injection vectors)
  - Robust error handling with clear diagnostics
  - Mandatory pre-flight validation + post-migration verification
  - Supports: dry-run (default), --apply, --force-unknown

  Quality Assurance Results

  Agent Feedback Applied:
  - ✅ code-reviewer: 98/100 confidence - Production-ready, all conventions met
  - ✅ silent-failure-hunter: Zero error handling issues identified
  - ✅ db-migration: Schema safety validated, no SQL injection vectors

  Issues Fixed (P0→P1→P2):
  - ✅ Import path corrected (@shared/ alias)
  - ✅ Type checking fixed (normalizeInvestmentStage return handling)
  - ✅ Table name mismatch resolved (portfoliocompanies)
  - ✅ Audit logging moved into main transaction (data integrity)
  - ✅ SQL injection prevention (parameterized queries)
  - ✅ Rollback error handling improved
  - ✅ Row result validation added

  Key Decisions Implemented

  1. Transactional Safety: Single BEGIN...COMMIT ensures atomicity
  2. Audit Logging: Within transaction prevents orphaned records
  3. Parameterization: Prevents SQL injection completely
  4. Error Handling: Clear diagnostics distinguish rollback failures
  5. Pre-flight Validation: Mandatory check with --force-unknown override
  6. Post-verification: Zero-tolerance verification queries
