## What "Done" Looks Like

### Primary Success Criteria

#### 1. Zero Sev-1 Defects
- **Current State:** [INSERT CURRENT SEV-1 COUNT]
- **Target:** 0 Sev-1 defects in production
- **Measurement:** Real-time defect tracking dashboard
- **Owner:** Senior Engineer + Engineering Team

#### 2. Validated User Experience  
- **Target:** â‰¥95% user journey completion rate
- **Target:** â‰¥90 Lighthouse accessibility score
- **Measurement:** Session replay analysis + automated accessibility testing
- **Owner:** UX Researcher + Frontend Engineer

### Secondary Success Criteria

#### 3. Quality Infrastructure
- **PR-level quality gates:** Lighthouse CI + axe-core blocking low-quality merges
- **SLO monitoring:** Burn-rate alerts for 1h/6h/3d windows
- **Automated triage:** ML-powered issue classification (â‰¥85% accuracy)

#### 4. Process Excellence
- **Bug bash completion:** 90-minute session with 8+ cross-functional participants
- **Documentation updates:** API docs, runbooks, incident response procedures
- **Performance baselines:** Regression detection with <10% false positive rate

## Resource Allocation

### Team Commitment
- **Total Capacity:** 21 ideal-days (7 days Ã— 3 person-days average)
- **Committed Work:** 21.5 ideal-days across 16 stories
- **Risk Buffer:** 2.5 days for unexpected complexity

### Story Priority Breakdown
- **P0 (Must-Have):** 7 stories, 9.5 ideal-days
- **P1 (Should-Have):** 5 stories (including performance optimizations), 8.5 ideal-days  
- **P2 (Nice-to-Have):** 4 stories, 4 ideal-days

## Risk Assessment & Mitigation

### High-Risk Items
1. **G2C-001: Sev-1 Bug Resolution (2 days)**
   - *Risk:* Unknown complexity of critical defects
   - *Mitigation:* Daily triage, escalation process, emergency hotfix procedures

2. **G2C-005: Accessibility Compliance (2 days)**
   - *Risk:* Cross-browser compatibility issues
   - *Mitigation:* Incremental testing, screen reader validation, ARIA implementation

### Contingency Planning
- **If P0s overrun:** P1/P2 stories can be deferred to next sprint
- **If critical blocker:** Emergency escalation to executive sponsors
- **If quality gates fail:** Documented bypass process with approval authority

## Daily Communication Plan

### Sprint Team Updates
- **Daily standups:** 15-min war-room sessions (Day 15-21)
- **Real-time alerts:** Slack integration for critical issues
- **Progress tracking:** Automated sprint board updates

### Stakeholder Updates
- **Day 16:** Bug bash results and triage summary
- **Day 17:** Burn-down review and scope check assessment
- **Day 18:** Mid-sprint checkpoint with scope adjustment recommendations  
- **Day 21:** Final sprint results and production readiness assessment

### Monitoring & Scope Check
- **Day 17 burn-down review:** Real-time assessment of remaining work vs capacity
- **Scope adjustment trigger:** Automatic escalation if P1/P2 work exceeds remaining capacity
- **Continuous monitoring:** Daily burn-down tracking with sprint board updates
