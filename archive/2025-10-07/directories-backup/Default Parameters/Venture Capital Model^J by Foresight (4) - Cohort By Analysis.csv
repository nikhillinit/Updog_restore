,Carry,%,,0.2,=E234,,,,,,"carry is the % of gains that are paid to the managers of the fund. part of the commonly cited ""2 and 20"" fees structure for funds",,
,Preferred Return,%,,0,=Forecast!E44,,,,,,"uncommon for US-based venture funds. see glossary for details. if you input a preferred return and 0 for GP catchup, then you are modeling a ""hard hurdle""",,
,GP Catchup,%,,0,=Forecast!E45,,,,,,"only relevant if assuming a preferred return, uncommon for US-based venture funds; see Glossary for definition on the terminology. this assumption is for the total catchup; on the Forecast sheet, you can assume the % distributed to the GP during the catchup period",,

,Management Fees time period (quarters),#,,=10*4,,,,,,,"time period used for assuming management fees, tied to the fund duration and not including the fund extension period, if applicable",,
,Fund Operations time period (quarters),#,,40,,,,,,,"time period used for assuming operational expenses, which is calculated from the new invesetment and exit timeframes, to cover the periods the fund incurrs operational expenses. you can override the calculated period if desired.",,
,Fund Duration Extension Period (quarters),#,,"=MAX(0,E19-E18)",,,,,,,"extra time period calculated from your deployment and holding period assumptions. purely for informational purposes, the model uses the fund duration for calculating management fees, this just shows how long of an extension you will need based on your assumptions",,
