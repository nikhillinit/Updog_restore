‚óè üîß ENHANCED REPLIT UI FIX COMMAND WITH 
  PERSISTENT FUND CONTEXT

  You are fixing the POVC Fund Model UI/UX
   in Replit with persistent fund
  management.

  IMMEDIATE UI FIXES REQUIRED:

  1. **IMPLEMENT FUND CONTEXT 
  PERSISTENCE**
     - Use Read tool on
  client/src/contexts/FundContext.tsx
     - Ensure fund data persists across        
  all pages after setup
     - Store fund configuration in
  localStorage or database
     - Prevent re-entry of fund parameters     
   on navigation

  2. **PROPER USER FLOW WITH STATE 
  MANAGEMENT**
     - Use Read tool on client/src/App.tsx     
   to check routing
     - Create fund setup onboarding as
  landing experience
     - After fund setup: redirect to
  dashboard with persistent data
     - All pages (forecasting, reporting,      
  management) use same fund context

  3. **FIX SIDEBAR NAVIGATION WITH FUND        
  STATE**
     - Use Read tool on
  client/src/components/layout/sidebar.tsx     
     - Navigation only appears after fund      
  is configured
     - All sidebar routes share the same       
  fund data
     - No re-prompting for fund parameters     

  4. **SEAMLESS WORKFLOW IMPLEMENTATION**      
     - Fund Setup ‚Üí Dashboard ‚Üí
  Forecasting ‚Üí Reporting ‚Üí Management
     - Each section accesses the same fund     
   configuration
     - Header shows current fund
  name/details consistently
     - Settings page allows fund parameter     
   editing if needed

  5. **PROFESSIONAL CHART INTEGRATION**        
     - Use Read tool on
  client/src/components/charts/ directory      
     - Charts automatically populate with      
  fund data
     - Remove exposed/raw chart elements       
     - Add proper loading states and fund      
  context

  EXECUTION ORDER:
  1. Verify FundContext provides
  persistent state management
  2. Fix routing: setup ‚Üí persistent fund      
  dashboard
  3. Ensure all pages consume fund context     
   without re-entry
  4. Polish navigation and chart
  presentation
  5. Test complete workflow: setup once,       
  navigate freely

  CRITICAL: Once fund is set up, user
  should NEVER re-enter fund parameters        
  when navigating between forecasting,
  reporting, and management sections.

  DO NOT explain. IMPLEMENT persistent
  fund state and fix UX immediately.

  Begin fixes now.

  üìã USE THIS ENHANCED COMMAND IN REPLIT       

  This ensures the fund setup is a
  one-time process, with all subsequent        
  pages using the persistent fund data
  seamlessly.
