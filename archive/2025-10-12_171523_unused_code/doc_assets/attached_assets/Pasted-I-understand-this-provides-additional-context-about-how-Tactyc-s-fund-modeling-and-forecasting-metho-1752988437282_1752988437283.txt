I understand this provides additional context about how Tactyc's fund modeling and forecasting methodology works. Looking at the documentation and charts, I can see this shows the comprehensive workflow from portfolio construction to deal-level forecasting and performance tracking.

Let me restart the workflow and then implement the enhanced forecasting dashboard that incorporates these Tactyc methodologies:

Now I'll implement an enhanced forecasting dashboard that incorporates the Tactyc methodologies shown in your documentation. This will include the investable capital summary, projected fund performance charts, and portfolio insights:

Let me first view the current forecasting page to see its structure:

Let me create a comprehensive enhanced forecasting dashboard that incorporates the Tactyc methodology from your documentation:

Let me fix the forecasting page import issue and complete the implementation:

Let me view the current forecasting file structure and complete the implementation:

Let me replace the entire forecasting tab structure to complete the enhanced implementation:

Let me view the exact structure and complete the forecasting page update:

Let me add the complete enhanced Tactyc dashboard functionality to the existing structure:

I see there's a syntax error in the forecasting file. Let me fix the issue and restart the workflow:

I need to fix the syntax error in the forecasting file. There's a misplaced Card component that's not within a proper TabsContent:

I need to fix the JSX syntax error. There seems to be an unclosed tag. Let me fix the entire file structure:

Perfect! The enhanced forecasting dashboard is now properly structured. Let me update the default tab to show the Capital Summary first since that's the key Tactyc functionality:

Let me restart the workflow to fix the syntax error and complete the implementation:
