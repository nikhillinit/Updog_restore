## Pre-Deployment Verification âœ…

- âœ… **Branch**: feat/schema-helpers-clean (clean working directory)
- âœ… **Build**: `npm run build` passes successfully
- âœ… **TypeScript**: `npm run check` passes with 0 errors
- âœ… **Health Endpoints**: `/health`, `/api/healthz`, `/api/readyz` implemented
- âœ… **Security**: Helmet, CSP, CORS, HSTS all configured
- âœ… **Railway Config**: railway.toml properly configured

## Deployment Commands

### Step 1: Authentication & Project Setup

```bash
# Login to Railway (opens browser for authentication)
railway login

# Initialize project in current directory
railway init

# Create project name: updog-fund-platform
# Link to existing project: No
```

### Step 2: Add Required Services

```bash
# Add PostgreSQL database
railway add postgresql

# Add Redis cache
railway add redis

# Verify services are created
railway status
```

### Step 3: Environment Configuration

```bash
# Set production environment
railway variables set NODE_ENV=production

# Set CORS origin (replace with actual Railway URL)
railway variables set CORS_ORIGIN=https://updog-fund-platform.up.railway.app

# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Note: DATABASE_URL and REDIS_URL are auto-configured by Railway
```

### Step 4: Deploy Application

```bash
# Deploy from current branch
railway up --detach

# Get deployment status
railway status

# Open live application
railway open
```

## Validation Checklist

### Immediate Validation (0-5 minutes)

- [ ] Application deploys without errors
- [ ] Health endpoint responds: `curl https://your-app.railway.app/health`
- [ ] Database connection verified:
      `curl https://your-app.railway.app/api/readyz`
- [ ] Frontend loads in browser
- [ ] No critical console errors

### Functional Validation (5-15 minutes)

- [ ] Fund setup wizard loads
- [ ] Can navigate through wizard steps
- [ ] Form validation works correctly
- [ ] Data persists between steps
- [ ] Security headers present (check Network tab)

### Performance Validation (15-30 minutes)

- [ ] Page load times < 2 seconds
- [ ] API response times < 500ms
- [ ] No memory leaks or excessive resource usage
- [ ] Synthetic monitoring workflow triggers successfully

## Expected Deployment URLs

- **Application**: `https://updog-fund-platform.up.railway.app`
- **Health Check**: `https://updog-fund-platform.up.railway.app/health`
- **API Health**: `https://updog-fund-platform.up.railway.app/api/healthz`
- **Fund Setup**: `https://updog-fund-platform.up.railway.app/fund-setup`

---

## Troubleshooting

### If Health Checks Fail

```bash
# Check application logs
railway logs --tail

# Verify environment variables
railway variables

# Check service status
railway status
```

### If Database Connection Fails

```bash
# Verify PostgreSQL service is running
railway status

# Check DATABASE_URL format
railway variables | grep DATABASE_URL

# Test local connection (if needed)
psql $DATABASE_URL -c "SELECT 1"
```

### If Deployment Fails

```bash
# Check build logs
railway logs --deployment

# Verify package.json scripts
npm run build:prod

# Check railway.toml configuration
cat railway.toml
```

## Success Criteria

### âœ… Deployment Successful When:

1. **Application accessible** at Railway URL
2. **Health endpoints green** (200 OK responses)
3. **Fund setup wizard functional** (can complete step 1)
4. **Database connectivity verified** (readiness check passes)
5. **Security headers present** (CSP, HSTS, CORS configured)

### ðŸ“‹ Post-Deployment Actions:

1. Update GitHub repository with live URL
2. Begin user testing and feedback collection
3. Monitor performance and error rates
4. Plan next iteration based on usage data
