## üí∞ ROI CALCULATION

### Time Savings

**Current Process (per valuation):**

- Search for comps in PitchBook: 15 min
- Build Excel model: 30 min
- Adjust assumptions: 10 min per iteration
- **Total: 55 min + (10 min √ó iterations)**

**With Compass:**

- Search comps: 30 seconds (autocomplete)
- Calculate: instant (sliders)
- Iterations: instant
- **Total: < 2 minutes**

**Savings:** ~50 minutes per valuation **Usage:** 4 GPs √ó 5 valuations/week = 20
valuations/week **Total Savings:** **16 hours/week = $24K/year** (at $150/hr
loaded cost)

### Decision Quality

- **Faster IC prep** ‚Üí More time for strategic discussions
- **Scenario exploration** ‚Üí Better risk assessment
- **Portfolio visibility** ‚Üí Pattern recognition across companies

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS

### 1. Managing Partner Buy-In (ACHIEVED)

- ‚úÖ Partners confirmed as valuation experts
- ‚úÖ Weekly 90-min commitment secured
- ‚úÖ Explicit "sandbox only" framing agreed

### 2. Intern as Domain Translator (CRITICAL PATH)

- **Week 1 Action:** Formal kickoff with intern
- **Week 1 Deliverable:** Intern creates "Current State Assessment" memo
- **Week 2-6:** Intern validates calculator against Excel

### 3. Avoiding Scope Creep (ANTI-SCOPE)

**Never Build:**

- ‚ùå PDF report generation
- ‚ùå LP portal integration
- ‚ùå Formal audit trails
- ‚ùå Approval workflows

**If Anyone Asks:** "Compass is for internal exploration only. Excel remains the
official source of truth."

## üéØ SUCCESS DEFINITION

### What Success Looks Like (Month 6)

- ‚úÖ All GPs use Compass **weekly**
- ‚úÖ Used in **80% of IC meetings**
- ‚úÖ Partners say: **"How did we live without this?"**
- ‚úÖ Intern has **thesis + publication + job offer**
- ‚úÖ **Zero** requests to make it "official" (proves sandbox framing worked)

### What Failure Looks Like (Avoid)

- ‚ùå Tool sits unused after launch
- ‚ùå Partners ask for "official marks export"
- ‚ùå Intern quits due to scope creep
- ‚ùå Project drags past 6 months

## üí° KEY INSIGHTS FROM MULTI-AGENT ANALYSIS

### From Gemini (Architecture)

- Use multi-layer caching (Redis + PostgreSQL) for comp data
- Client-side calculation for sub-second performance
- Dedicated `compass` schema for data isolation

### From Gemini (Risk Mitigation)

- #1 Risk: Not treating as financial engineering project
- Solution: Intern validates every formula against Excel
- Test-driven development against "Golden Spreadsheets"

### From Gemini (UX Design)

- "Glass box" UI: Show every calculation step
- Real-time updates on all input changes
- Portfolio heatmap for pattern recognition

### Consensus Recommendation

**"Build the sandbox, NOT the system of record"**

- Ruthlessly avoid compliance features
- Optimize for GP utility and speed
- Keep Excel as official source of truth
- Success = Weekly usage, not audit approval
