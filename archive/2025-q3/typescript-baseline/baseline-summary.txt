Performance Baseline Summary - Async Infrastructure PR

Infrastructure Added:
✅ Vitest benchmark setup (tests/load/async-batch.bench.ts)
✅ Smart migration script with dry-run (scripts/smart-fix.js)
✅ Performance baseline CI workflow (.github/workflows/perf-baseline.yml)
✅ ESLint rule for async safety (eslint-rules/no-async-array-methods.js)
✅ Pre-push performance hooks (.husky/pre-push)
✅ PR template with perf tracking (.github/pull_request_template.md)
✅ VS Code dev snippets (.vscode/project.code-snippets)
✅ Migration progress log (.async-migration-log)

Async Utilities Ready:
- forEachAsync: Serial processing with early termination
- mapAsync: Parallel/batched mapping with concurrency control
- processAsync: Void operations with error handling

Next Steps:
1. Trigger CI baseline run
2. Create batch-1 migration PR (80 files max)
3. Monitor performance regression gates

This PR establishes the foundation for safe, measured async iteration migration.
