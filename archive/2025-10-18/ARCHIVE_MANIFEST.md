## Why BMad Was Archived

### Rationale

1. **Experimental Adoption Failed:**
   - BMad methodology was tried once in **July 2025**
   - Encountered unrelated technical errors during initial adoption
   - Workflow was dropped entirely and never resumed
   - Zero active usage since July experiment

2. **Missing Required Infrastructure:**
   - No `.bmad-core/` directory exists in codebase
   - No `core-config.yaml` configuration file
   - No BMad story files (`*.story.md`) found
   - No sharded PRD structure
   - No BMad checklists or templates

3. **Superseded by Official Claude Code Plugins:**
   - **PR Review Toolkit** - 6 specialized review agents (comment-analyzer,
     pr-test-analyzer, silent-failure-hunter, type-design-analyzer,
     code-reviewer, code-simplifier)
   - **Feature Development Plugin** - Structured 7-phase workflow with
     code-explorer, code-architect, code-reviewer agents
   - **Commit Commands Plugin** - Git automation (/commit, /commit-push-pr,
     /clean_gone)

4. **Superior Custom Commands Already Active:**
   - `/test-smart` - Intelligent test selection (actively used)
   - `/fix-auto` - Automated repair (actively used)
   - `/deploy-check` - Pre-deployment validation (actively used)
   - `/perf-guard` - Performance regression detection (actively used)
   - `/dev-start` - Environment setup (actively used)

5. **Existing Memory Management System:**
   - `/log-change` - CHANGELOG.md updates
   - `/log-decision` - DECISIONS.md updates
   - `/create-cheatsheet` - Documentation generation
   - CLAUDE.md - Core architecture guidance
   - cheatsheets/ - Detailed workflow guides

6. **Zero Breaking Changes:**
   - BMad commands are optional slash commands, not code dependencies
   - No imports of BMad commands found in TypeScript/JavaScript code
   - No active workflows depend on BMad personas or tasks
   - Clean removal with zero impact on development velocity

## Total Space Reclaimed

| Category       | Files        | Approximate Size |
| -------------- | ------------ | ---------------- |
| Agent Personas | 10 files     | ~100KB           |
| Task Workflows | 17 files     | ~128KB           |
| **TOTAL**      | **27 files** | **~228KB**       |

## Verification Performed

### Pre-Archive Checks ✅

- [x] Grep entire codebase for BMad command imports - zero active usage found
- [x] Verified no `.bmad-core/` directory exists
- [x] Verified no `*.story.md` files exist
- [x] Verified no `core-config.yaml` exists
- [x] Confirmed official Claude Code plugins provide superior functionality
- [x] Confirmed custom project commands are actively maintained
- [x] Used `git mv` to preserve full file history

### Post-Archive Verification ✅

- [x] BMad directories removed cleanly
- [x] All 27 files successfully moved to archive
- [x] Git history preserved for all archived files

## What Replaces BMad

### Official Claude Code Plugins (Recommended for Installation)

#### 1. PR Review Toolkit

**Provides 6 specialized review agents:**

- `comment-analyzer` - Verify comment accuracy vs code
- `pr-test-analyzer` - Analyze test coverage quality (behavioral vs line
  coverage)
- `silent-failure-hunter` - Check error handling and silent failures
- `type-design-analyzer` - Review TypeScript type design (encapsulation,
  invariants)
- `code-reviewer` - CLAUDE.md compliance and bug detection
- `code-simplifier` - Code clarity and refactoring

**Installation:**

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugins
# Search for "pr-review-toolkit" and install
```

#### 2. Feature Development Plugin

**Provides structured 7-phase workflow:**

1. Discovery - Clarify requirements
2. Codebase Exploration - Launches 2-3 `code-explorer` agents in parallel
3. Clarifying Questions - Fill gaps before design
4. Architecture Design - Launches 2-3 `code-architect` agents
   (minimal/clean/pragmatic)
5. Implementation - Build with approval gates
6. Quality Review - 3 parallel `code-reviewer` agents
7. Summary - Document decisions

**Installation:**

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugins
# Search for "feature-dev" and install
```

#### 3. Commit Commands Plugin

**Provides git workflow automation:**

- `/commit` - Auto-generate commit message from staged/unstaged changes
- `/commit-push-pr` - Commit, push, and create PR in one step
- `/clean_gone` - Clean up stale [gone] branches

**Installation:**

```bash
# In Claude Code
/plugins
# Search for "commit-commands" and install
```

### Custom Commands (Remain Active)

These project-specific commands remain in active use:

**Development Tools:**

- `/test-smart` - Intelligent test selection based on file changes
- `/fix-auto` - Automated repair of lint, format, and simple test failures
- `/deploy-check` - Pre-deployment validation (build, bundle, smoke,
  idempotency)
- `/perf-guard` - Performance regression detection with bundle analysis
- `/dev-start` - Optimized development environment setup

**Memory Management:**

- `/log-change` - Update CHANGELOG.md with timestamped changes
- `/log-decision` - Update DECISIONS.md with architectural decisions
- `/create-cheatsheet [topic]` - Create new cheatsheet documentation

## Rollback Instructions

If any issues are discovered (unlikely), rollback is straightforward:

### Option 1: Restore Entire BMad Infrastructure

```bash
git mv archive/2025-10-18/bmad-infrastructure/agents/*.md repo/.claude/commands/BMad/agents/
git mv archive/2025-10-18/bmad-infrastructure/tasks/*.md repo/.claude/commands/BMad/tasks/
```

### Option 2: Restore Specific Command

```bash
# Example: Restore /create-next-story
git mv archive/2025-10-18/bmad-infrastructure/tasks/create-next-story.md repo/.claude/commands/BMad/tasks/
```

### Option 3: Revert Archive Commit

```bash
git revert <archive-commit-hash>
```

---

## Why This Archive Was Safe

1. **Zero Active Usage:** BMad was tried once in July 2025 and dropped - no
   active workflows depend on it
2. **No Code Dependencies:** BMad commands are slash commands, not imported code
3. **Missing Infrastructure:** No `.bmad-core/`, `core-config.yaml`, or
   `*.story.md` files exist
4. **Git History Preserved:** Used `git mv` to maintain full line-level history
5. **Superior Replacements:** Official Claude Code plugins provide better,
   maintained alternatives
6. **Custom Commands Unaffected:** Project-specific commands (`/test-smart`,
   `/fix-auto`, etc.) remain active
7. **Documentation Intact:** CLAUDE.md, DECISIONS.md, CHANGELOG.md, cheatsheets/
   unaffected

### Week 2: Integration & Documentation

1. Update `CLAUDE.md` to reference new plugins (remove BMad sections)
2. Create `cheatsheets/pr-review-workflow.md`
3. Update `DECISIONS.md` with plugin adoption decision
4. Log changes to `CHANGELOG.md`

### Week 3: Feature Development Plugin

1. Install **Feature Development** plugin
2. Test `/feature-dev` on a medium-complexity feature
3. Create `cheatsheets/feature-dev-usage.md`
4. Document when to use `/feature-dev` vs custom commands
