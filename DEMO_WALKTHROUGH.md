## **‚ùå What's NOT Working (Avoid Showing)**

### **1. Fund Setup Wizard**

**Avoid because:** Demo shows simplified 5-item IA

### **3. Some Advanced Features**
- Time-Travel Analytics (`/time-travel`) - ‚ö†Ô∏è Experimental
- Variance Tracking (`/variance-tracking`) - ‚ö†Ô∏è Early stage
- Portfolio Constructor (`/portfolio-constructor`) - ‚ö†Ô∏è Beta

## **üö® Emergency Rollback**

If something breaks mid-demo:

### **Option 1: Disable feature flags (browser console)**
```javascript
localStorage.removeItem('FF_NEW_IA');
localStorage.removeItem('FF_ENABLE_SELECTOR_KPIS');
location.reload();
```

### **Option 2: Navigate to stable route**
```
Go to /dashboard (always works)
```

### **Option 3: Blame "demo mode"**
```
"This is demo mode‚Äîin production we have better error handling.
Let me show you something else..."
```
