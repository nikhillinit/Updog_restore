# Fund Model Development Status

## Current Session Progress

### Infrastructure & CI/CD Improvements ✅

#### 1. Enhanced CI Workflow
- ✅ **Added feature flag system**: `vars.CI_EXPERIMENTAL` for gating experimental features
- ✅ **Concurrency control**: Prevents multiple runs on same branch with `cancel-in-progress: true`
- ✅ **ETag generation**: Experimental job for generating build artifacts with ETags
- ✅ **Lint integration**: Added linting step to CI pipeline with caching

#### 2. ESLint Performance Optimization 
- ✅ **Built-in caching**: Updated package.json lint scripts to use `--cache --cache-location .eslintcache`
- ✅ **Faster CI builds**: ESLint now caches results between runs

#### 3. Test Stability Improvements
- ✅ **Fixed timing-sensitive tests**: Added fake timers to BaseAgent and async-iteration tests
- ✅ **Deterministic test behavior**: Replaced real setTimeout with controlled timer advancement
- ✅ **Mock fixes**: Corrected logger mock implementation

### Key Files Modified
1. `.github/workflows/test.yml` - Enhanced CI with feature flags and caching
2. `package.json` - Added ESLint caching
3. `packages/agent-core/src/__tests__/BaseAgent.test.ts` - Fixed timing tests
4. `tests/utils/async-iteration.test.ts` - Fixed parallel processing tests

## Outstanding PR Summary (From Previous Analysis)

### High Priority - Recently Created
1. **PR #26** - `ci: test script fix + etag tuning` (ci-etag-tuning branch)
2. **PR #25** - `ci: enhance test workflow with caching, concurrency & health-check` (ci-parallel-optimizations branch)

### Active Development  
3. **PR #22** - `feat: enable autofix for async-array-method rule` (eslint-autofix branch) - DRAFT
4. **PR #21** - `feat: replace Slack notifications with ETag generation` (ci-slack-notifications branch)

### Documentation & Code Quality
5. **PR #19** - `fix: async iteration hardening, tests + eslint rules` (async-iteration-hardening branch)
6. **PR #18** - `Restore Sprint G2C docs` (restore-g2c-docs-to-main branch)
7. **PR #17** - `Restore Sprint G2C Planning Documentation` (release/v1.0.0 branch)

## Merge Strategy Assessment

### Immediate Infrastructure Merges (Safe)
- Current changes can be merged immediately as they improve CI/CD without breaking functionality
- ESLint caching is backward compatible
- Test fixes eliminate flaky behavior

### Git Conflicts Encountered
- Documentation PRs (#17, #18) have conflicts with chart components
- These conflicts appear to be from different development branches rather than documentation changes
- Recommendation: Cherry-pick documentation files directly rather than merging complex branches

## Next Steps

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Foundation (Current Session - ✅ Complete)
- [x] CI feature flag system
- [x] ESLint caching optimization
- [x] Test stability fixes

### Phase 2: PR Consolidation (Next Priority)
1. **Merge safe infrastructure improvements** from PRs #25, #26
2. **Resolve documentation conflicts** by selective file restoration
3. **Complete ESLint autofix** from PR #22

### Phase 3: Advanced Features 
1. **ETag implementation** (from PR #21)
2. **Async iteration hardening** (from PR #19)
3. **Performance monitoring integration**

## Key Achievements This Session

1. **Robust CI Pipeline**: Feature-flagged experimental features with concurrency control
2. **Performance Optimization**: ESLint caching reduces build times
3. **Test Reliability**: Eliminated timing-dependent test failures
4. **Developer Experience**: Improved development workflow stability

## Technical Debt Addressed

- ❌ Flaky timing tests → ✅ Deterministic fake timer tests
- ❌ Slow ESLint runs → ✅ Cached ESLint execution
- ❌ Concurrent CI conflicts → ✅ Controlled CI execution
- ❌ Manual feature toggling → ✅ Feature flag system

## Current State
- **Branch**: Main branch with infrastructure improvements
- **Tests**: Stable and deterministic
- **CI**: Enhanced with modern best practices
- **Ready for**: PR consolidation and advanced feature development
