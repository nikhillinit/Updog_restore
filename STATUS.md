# Updog Fund Model Development Status

## Current Date: August 2, 2025

## Project Overview
We are developing a comprehensive fund model with CI/CD infrastructure, async iteration hardening, and React performance optimizations.

## Recent Accomplishments

### 1. âœ… Async Iteration Hardening (PR #19)
- **Status**: Updated and pushed, ready for review
- **Branch**: `async-iteration-hardening`
- **Key Changes**:
  - Replaced native array methods with async-safe alternatives
  - Added custom ESLint rule for async array operations
  - Updated all chart components and core engines
  - Added comprehensive test coverage
- **Merge Status**: 
  - All conflicts resolved (6 files)
  - Tests passing (76 passed, 113 skipped)
  - Ready for CI validation

### 2. ðŸ”„ CI/CD Workflow Enhancements
Multiple PRs in progress to improve CI/CD:
- **PR #26** - `ci: test script fix + etag tuning` (Ready for review)
- **PR #25** - `ci: enhance test workflow with caching, concurrency & health-check` (Ready for review)
- **PR #21** - `feat: replace Slack notifications with ETag generation` (Ready for review)

### 3. ðŸ“‹ Outstanding PRs Summary
- **6 PRs ready for review** (non-draft status)
- **1 PR in draft** (PR #22 - ESLint autofix)
- **Categories**:
  - CI/CD Improvements: PRs #26, #25, #21
  - Code Quality: PRs #22, #19
  - Documentation: PRs #18, #17

## Technical Details

### Test Status
- Core functionality working correctly
- 2 minor timing-related test failures (not critical):
  - `BaseAgent > should track execution duration`
  - `async-iteration > mapAsync parallel processing`
- E2E tests need page object files

### Known Issues
1. **ESLint Custom Rule**: The TypeScript rule needs compilation to JS
2. **E2E Tests**: Missing page object files in `tests/e2e/page-objects/`
3. **Timing Tests**: Need Jest fake timers for stability

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions
1. Review and merge PR #19 (async-iteration-hardening)
2. Enable experimental CI features after first green build
3. Fix ESLint custom rule compilation

### Recommended Workflow
1. Merge PRs in order of dependency:
   - First: PR #19 (async-iteration)
   - Then: CI improvement PRs (#26, #25, #21)
   - Finally: Documentation PRs (#18, #17)

2. After merging:
   - Tag version `v1.3.3-beta`
   - Enable `CI_EXPERIMENTAL` flag
   - Monitor CI performance improvements

### Development Environment
- **Current Branch**: `async-iteration-hardening`
- **Node Version**: Compatible with project requirements
- **Key Dependencies**: All installed and working

## CI/CD Strategy
Using GitHub's recommended conflict-first workflow:
- Experimental jobs disabled via `CI_EXPERIMENTAL: false`
- Will enable after first green build
- Expected ~50% reduction in CI time with caching

## Notes
- All merge conflicts successfully resolved
- Performance optimizations preserved
- React hooks properly maintained
- Async patterns consistently applied
