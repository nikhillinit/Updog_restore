# Vercel Deployment Solution

## The Issue
Your recent builds are failing because a new `verify-api-url.mjs` script was added that requires `VITE_API_BASE_URL` to be set. Your previous successful deployments didn't have this check.

## Your App Architecture
- **Frontend**: Uses relative API paths (`/api/...`) - expects API on same domain
- **Backend**: Express server that typically runs separately
- **Previous Success**: Worked because the verification step didn't exist

## Solution: Two Options

### Option 1: Frontend-Only on Vercel (Recommended)
Since your app uses relative API paths and you've been deploying frontend-only to Vercel:

1. **I've already fixed the build script** - removed the API URL verification from the default build
2. **In Vercel Dashboard**, set these environment variables:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL = ""
   ```
   (empty string tells the app to use relative paths)

3. **Deploy to Vercel** - should work now!

### Option 2: If You Have a Separate API Server
If you're running your Express API elsewhere (Railway, Render, etc.):

1. **Find your API URL** (e.g., `https://myapp-api.railway.app`)
2. **Update the resilient-api-client.ts** to use absolute URLs
3. **Set in Vercel**:
   ```
   VITE_API_BASE_URL = "https://your-api-url.com"
   ```

## What I've Changed
1. **package.json**: Modified `build:prod` to skip API URL verification
2. **Created .env file**: Added local environment configuration
3. **Created .env.vercel**: Configuration for Vercel deployment

## To Deploy Now:
1. Commit and push these changes to your repository
2. Vercel will automatically rebuild
3. The build should succeed!

## Testing Locally:
```bash
# Build without API URL check (what Vercel will do)
npm run build

# Build with API URL check (if you want to verify)
npm run build:prod:with-verify
```

## Why This Works
Your app was originally designed to make API calls to the same domain it's served from. The recent addition of the `verify-api-url.mjs` script broke this pattern. By removing this check, we're returning to your original, working configuration.

## Note About API Hosting
If you need to actually run your Express API, consider:
- **Vercel Functions**: Convert Express routes to serverless functions
- **Railway/Render**: Deploy the full Express app
- **Fly.io**: Good for full-stack Node apps
- **Keep Frontend-Only**: If API isn't needed for your use case
