# Quarantine Test Failures - Resolution Summary

## Executive Summary

The nightly quarantine test workflow experienced failures from September 27
through October 7, 2025. All issues have been resolved and tests are now passing
successfully.

## Timeline of Failures

### September 27-29, 2025 (Issues #94-#96)

**Root Cause**: Husky v9 compatibility issue in npm prepare script

**Error**:

```
TypeError: require(...).install is not a function
    at [eval]:1:24
```

**Explanation**:

- Husky v9 removed the `.install()` method
- The prepare script was using the old Husky v8 pattern:
  `require('husky').install()`
- This caused `npm ci` to fail before tests could even run

**Resolution**:

- Package.json updated to use Husky v9 compatible pattern: `husky || true`
- Prepare script now gracefully handles Husky installation

### September 30 - October 2, 2025 (Issues #98-#100)

**Root Cause**: Test timeout issues with async operations

**Explanation**:

- Global fake timers from setup files were blocking async operations
- Tests waiting for real timeouts while using fake timers
- Caused tests to hang and timeout (30000ms limit exceeded)

### October 7, 2025 (Issue #128)

**Root Cause**: Same as above - async timer conflicts

**Resolution**: Commit 14ec821

- Added `vi.useRealTimers()` to affected tests
- Fixed `inflight-simple.quarantine.test.ts`
- Fixed `inflight-capacity.quarantine.test.ts`
- Improved abort signal handling in mocks
- Added `reports/` to .gitignore

## Current Status

✅ **All tests passing**: 14 tests pass, 5 skipped (intentionally)

### Test Breakdown:

- `tests/unit/inflight-simple.quarantine.test.ts`: 7 tests ✅
- `tests/unit/inflight-capacity.quarantine.test.ts`: 7 tests ✅
- `tests/quarantine/fund-setup.smoke.quarantine.test.tsx`: 5 tests ⏭️ (skipped -
  requires real browser)

### Verification:

```bash
# Local execution
npm run test:quarantine
# ✓  quarantine  tests/unit/inflight-simple.quarantine.test.ts (7 tests) 67ms
# ✓  quarantine  tests/unit/inflight-capacity.quarantine.test.ts (7 tests) 202ms
# Test Files  2 passed | 1 skipped (3)
# Tests  14 passed | 5 skipped (19)

# CI mode execution
CI=true npm run test:quarantine
# Same results - all passing
```

## Lessons Learned

### 1. Husky Version Compatibility

- Always verify npm lifecycle scripts when upgrading major versions
- Use `|| true` pattern for optional setup scripts in CI
- Consider HUSKY=0 environment variable for CI to skip Husky entirely

### 2. Test Environment Setup

- Be careful with global test setup that uses fake timers
- Tests requiring real time should explicitly call `vi.useRealTimers()`
- Document timer usage requirements in test files

### 3. Workflow Error Reporting

- ✅ Workflow now properly handles npm installation failures
- ✅ Exit codes captured and reported in issues
- ✅ Artifacts generated even on failure for better debugging

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. ✅ Close issues #94-#100 as resolved
2. ⏸️ Consider if quarantine tests should graduate to main suite
3. ⏸️ Review if fund-setup tests can be moved to E2E suite

### Future Improvements

1. ✅ **Workflow Enhancement**: Improved error handling for npm installation
   failures (implemented)
2. ✅ **Better Error Context**: Added detailed failure reasons in issue
   notifications (implemented)
3. ⏸️ **Auto-Close Logic**: Close issues when subsequent runs pass
4. ⏸️ **Quarantine Graduation**: Automate promotion when tests pass 10/10 times

## Workflow Improvements (This PR)

### Enhanced Error Handling

- Added `continue-on-error: true` to npm install step
- Tests only run if installation succeeds
- Workflow continues even if tests fail to ensure artifacts are uploaded

### Improved Issue Reporting

The automated issue now includes:

- **Failure reason**: Distinguishes between installation and test failures
- **Installation status**: Shows if npm ci succeeded or failed
- **Test exit code**: Captures actual test failure exit code
- **Better next steps**: Tailored guidance based on failure type

### Example Issue Output

```markdown
## Quarantine Tests Failed - 2025-10-10

The nightly quarantine test run has failed.

- **Failure reason:** **Installation failed** - Check workflow logs for npm ci
  errors
- **Installation status:** failure
- **Test exit code:** N/A
- **Workflow run:** [View run](https://github.com/.../actions/runs/123)
- **Artifacts:** vitest-quarantine-reports

### Next Steps

1. Download the test artifacts to see detailed failure information
2. If installation failed, check for dependency or script issues
3. If tests failed, fix the failing tests or adjust timeouts if needed
4. When tests pass 10/10 times, graduate them back to the main suite
```

## Files Changed

### This PR: Workflow Improvements

- `.github/workflows/quarantine-nightly.yml`:
  - Added error handling for npm installation failures
  - Conditional test execution (only if install succeeds)
  - Enhanced issue reporting with failure context
  - Better exit code capture and reporting
- `docs/quarantine-test-resolution.md`: Comprehensive documentation

### Commit 14ec821 (Fix quarantine tests)

- `tests/unit/inflight-capacity.quarantine.test.ts`: Added `vi.useRealTimers()`
  to all tests
- `tests/unit/inflight-simple.quarantine.test.ts`: Added `vi.useRealTimers()` to
  async test
- `.gitignore`: Added `reports/` to exclude test artifacts

### Package.json (Already Fixed)

```json
{
  "prepare": "chmod +x scripts/verify-docs-and-env.sh || true && husky || true"
}
```
