# Exit Recycling Calculations

**Module**: `client/src/lib/exit-recycling-calculations.ts` **Schema**:
`shared/schemas/recycling-policy.ts` **Purpose**: Pure functions for calculating
exit proceeds recycling schedules, caps, and capital availability

---

## Module Overview

Exit recycling calculations model how VC funds can reinvest early exit proceeds
back into new investments within LPA-defined limits. This extends a fund's
deployment capacity beyond initial committed capital during the recycling
period.

**Key Responsibilities:**

- Calculate maximum recyclable capital based on fund size and cap percentage
- Determine exit eligibility based on recycling period
- Apply recycling rates to eligible proceeds
- Enforce recycling caps chronologically across multiple exits
- Generate year-by-year recycling schedules
- Validate recycling configurations against industry norms

**Integration Points:**

- **Fee Calculations** (`client/src/lib/fee-calculations.ts`): Management fee
  recycling is separate but complementary
- **Modeling Wizard** (`client/src/components/modeling-wizard`): Collects
  recycling policy inputs
- **Fund Calc V2** (`client/src/lib/fund-calc-v2.ts`): Uses recycling capacity
  for deployment planning

## Core Concepts

### What is Exit Recycling?

Exit recycling allows a VC fund to reinvest a portion of early exit proceeds
rather than immediately distributing all proceeds to LPs. This extends
investment capacity beyond the initial fund size.

**Example:**

- $100M fund with 15% recycling cap ($15M maximum)
- Exit in year 3: $50M gross, 20% ownership = $10M fund proceeds
- 75% recycling rate: $7.5M recycled, $2.5M distributed to LPs
- Extended capacity: $100M + $7.5M = $107.5M total deployable

### Recycling Capacity

**Maximum Recyclable Capital** is calculated as a percentage of committed
capital:

```typescript
maxRecyclableCapital = fundSize × (recyclingCapPercent / 100)
```

**Annual Recycling Capacity** distributes the cap evenly across the recycling
period:

```typescript
annualRecyclingCapacity = maxRecyclableCapital / recyclingPeriod;
```

**Example:**

- Fund: $100M
- Cap: 15% = $15M
- Period: 5 years
- Annual capacity: $15M / 5 = $3M/year

### Exit Events and Eligibility

An **ExitEvent** represents a portfolio company exit:

```typescript
interface ExitEvent {
  id: string;
  year: number; // Relative to vintage
  grossProceeds: number; // Total exit value ($M)
  ownershipPercent: number; // Fund's stake (%)
  fundProceeds: number; // Fund's share ($M)
  withinRecyclingPeriod: boolean; // Eligibility flag
}
```

**Eligibility Rule**: An exit is eligible if `exitYear <= recyclingPeriod`

**Example:**

- Recycling period: 5 years
- Exit in year 3: ✅ Eligible (3 <= 5)
- Exit in year 7: ❌ Not eligible (7 > 5)

### Recycling Rate

The **exit recycling rate** determines what percentage of eligible proceeds are
recycled vs. distributed:

```typescript
recycledAmount = min(
  eligibleProceeds × (recyclingRate / 100),
  remainingCapacity
)
```

**Example:**

- Exit proceeds: $10M (eligible)
- Recycling rate: 75%
- Potential recycling: $10M × 0.75 = $7.5M
- Returned to LPs: $10M - $7.5M = $2.5M

### Cap Enforcement

Recycling cap is enforced **chronologically** across all exits:

1. Sort exits by year
2. Process in order
3. Track remaining capacity
4. Stop when cap reached
5. Excess proceeds to LPs

**Example:**

- Cap: $15M, Rate: 100%
- Exit A (year 2): $10M → recycle $10M, remaining: $5M
- Exit B (year 3): $8M → recycle $5M (cap limit), return $3M to LPs
- Exit C (year 4): $5M → recycle $0 (cap exhausted), return $5M to LPs

### Term Limits

The **recycling period** defines the eligibility window measured from fund
vintage year:

- **Typical Range**: 3-5 years
- **Short Periods** (<3 years): May not capture meaningful exits
- **Long Periods** (>7 years): May overlap with fund harvest period
- **Maximum**: 10 years (validation limit)

**Boundary Condition**: Year == period is **inclusive** (year 5 exit eligible in
5-year period)

---

## Mathematical Foundations

### Capacity Calculations

**Formula 1: Maximum Recyclable Capital**

```
maxRecyclableCapital = fundSize × (recyclingCapPercent / 100)
```

Example: $100M fund × 15% = $15M cap

**Formula 2: Annual Recycling Capacity**

```
annualCapacity = maxRecyclableCapital / recyclingPeriod
```

Example: $15M cap / 5 years = $3M/year

---

### Exit Recycling Calculations

**Formula 3: Recyclable Amount from Single Exit**

```
IF exitYear <= recyclingPeriod THEN
  potentialRecycling = fundProceeds × (recyclingRate / 100)
  recycledAmount = MIN(potentialRecycling, remainingCapacity)
ELSE
  recycledAmount = 0
END IF
```

**Formula 4: LP Distribution**

```
returnedToLPs = fundProceeds - recycledAmount
```

---

### Schedule Calculation Algorithm

**Input:**

- Exits: Array of exit events
- Recycling rate: Percentage to recycle
- Max cap: Total recycling capacity

**Algorithm:**

1. Sort exits chronologically by year
2. Initialize: `remainingCapacity = maxRecyclableCapital`
3. For each exit in order:
   - Check eligibility: `withinRecyclingPeriod`
   - Calculate: `recycledAmount = min(proceeds × rate, remainingCapacity)`
   - Update: `remainingCapacity -= recycledAmount`
   - Record: LP distribution = proceeds - recycled
4. Aggregate: Build cumulative totals by year
5. Return: Complete schedule with breakdown

**Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting + O(n) for processing = O(n log n)

---

### Extended Investment Capacity

Exit recycling extends the fund's total deployable capital:

**Formula 5: Effective Deployment Rate**

```
effectiveDeploymentRate = ((fundSize + totalRecycled) / fundSize) × 100
```

Example:

- Fund: $100M
- Total recycled: $15M
- Effective rate: ($115M / $100M) × 100 = 115%

- Floating-point tolerance: 0.01 for cap reached check

- Single exit recycling: O(1)
- Schedule calculation: O(n log n) where n = number of exits
  - Sorting: O(n log n)
