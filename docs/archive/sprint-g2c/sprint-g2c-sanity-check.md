## Questions for FE/BE Leads
1. Do the assigned owners have availability for these specific timeframes?
2. Are the estimates realistic given current technical debt?
3. Any dependencies between stories that could cause blockers?
4. Should we adjust P1/P2 story priorities based on team capacity?

## Risk Assessment
- **High Risk:** G2C-001 (Sev-1 fixes) - Unknown complexity
- **Medium Risk:** G2C-005 (Accessibility) - Potential cross-browser issues  
- **Low Risk:** Most P1/P2 stories can be deferred if P0s overrun

**Action Required:** Please review and confirm by EOD today for tomorrow's planning session.
