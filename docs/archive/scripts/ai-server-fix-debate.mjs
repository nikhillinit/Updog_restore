# Debate Topic: Fresh Install vs Restore Lockfile

## Initial AI Consensus (4/4 AIs)
Recommended: Delete package-lock.json and run fresh \`npm install\`
Reasoning: Avoids stale dependencies, ensures lockfile matches current package.json

## Expert Pushback
"Fresh install throws away determinism and can silently bump transitive deps.
Prefer restore + \`npm ci\` over regenerate. Only regenerate when no good lockfile exists."

## The Question
Which approach is ACTUALLY better for this scenario?

## Project Context
- Venture capital fund modeling platform (production system)
- package-lock.json was DELETED in commit c60dead (Oct 3, 2025)
- Last known-good lockfile: commit a795897 (before Oct 3)
- Unknown if package.json changed between a795897 and c60dead
- RECURRENT problem (happened multiple times)

## Two Approaches

### Approach A: Fresh Install (AI Consensus)
\`\`\`bash
rm package-lock.json
npm install  # Generates new lockfile
\`\`\`
Pros: No version conflicts, matches current package.json
Cons: Loses determinism, transitive deps may change silently

### Approach B: Restore + npm ci (Expert Recommendation)
\`\`\`bash
git restore a795897 -- package-lock.json
npm ci  # Fails if lockfile/package.json mismatch
\`\`\`
Pros: Preserves determinism, reproducible builds
Cons: Fails if package.json changed since a795897

## Your Task
Debate which approach is better for THIS specific scenario.
Consider: production stability, risk tolerance, reproducibility needs.
Be specific about edge cases and failure modes.

You are arguing FOR Approach A (Fresh Install).
Defend why fresh \`npm install\` is BETTER than restore+\`npm ci\` for this scenario.
Address the "lost determinism" criticism directly.
Be persuasive but honest about trade-offs.`

You are arguing FOR Approach B (Restore + npm ci).

You are the judge. You've heard both arguments:

**POSITION A (Fresh Install):**
${positionA.content[0].text}

**POSITION B (Restore + npm ci):**
${positionB.choices[0].message.content}

Your task:
1. Identify the strongest points from each side
2. Determine which approach is BETTER for this specific scenario
3. Provide a HYBRID solution if appropriate
4. Give specific implementation steps

Be decisive but fair. Consider production risk vs development velocity.`);
