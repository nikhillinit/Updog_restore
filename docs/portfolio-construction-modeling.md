# Portfolio Construction Modeling

This document describes the comprehensive portfolio construction modeling system that extends our existing variance tracking and time-travel analytics foundation.

## Overview

The portfolio construction modeling system enables sophisticated "what-if" scenario planning for venture capital funds, with capabilities for:

- **Forward-looking fund strategy modeling** with allocation rules and constraints
- **Multiple scenario planning** with different market assumptions
- **Dynamic reserve allocation strategies** with optimization
- **Performance forecasting** with Monte Carlo simulations
- **Scenario comparison and analysis** for decision support

## Architecture

The system consists of 6 main tables that work together:

```
Fund Strategy Models → Portfolio Scenarios → Performance Forecasts
                    ↓                     ↓
Reserve Allocation Strategies ← Monte Carlo Simulations
                    ↓
             Scenario Comparisons
```

### Integration with Existing Systems

- **Variance Tracking**: Performance forecasts link to fund baselines for comparison
- **Time-Travel Analytics**: Scenarios can reference historical snapshots for validation
- **Core Fund Data**: All models tie back to the main funds and investments tables

## Core Tables

### 1. Fund Strategy Models (`fund_strategy_models`)

Defines the overarching investment strategy for a fund.

**Key Features:**
- Target portfolio size and deployment timeline
- Sector, stage, and geographic allocation rules
- Reserve strategy and follow-on criteria
- Risk parameters and concentration limits
- Performance targets (IRR, multiple, DPI)

**Example Use Cases:**
- Create a "Series A Growth Strategy" for a $100M fund
- Define sector allocation: 30% enterprise software, 20% fintech, etc.
- Set concentration limits: max 15% per company, 35% per sector

### 2. Portfolio Scenarios (`portfolio_scenarios`)

Multiple "what-if" scenarios based on different market assumptions.

**Key Features:**
- Scenario types: base case, optimistic, pessimistic, stress test
- Market environment assumptions (bull, normal, bear, recession)
- Planned investment schedule and company details
- Performance projections and risk analysis
- Monte Carlo simulation integration

**Example Use Cases:**
- Model portfolio construction under different market conditions
- Plan investment timing and check sizes
- Analyze sensitivity to market changes

### 3. Reserve Allocation Strategies (`reserve_allocation_strategies`)

Dynamic strategies for deploying follow-on capital.

**Key Features:**
- Strategy types: proportional, milestone-based, performance-based, opportunistic
- Company scoring and ranking criteria
- Reserve tranches with deployment triggers
- Optimization objectives and constraints
- Performance attribution and backtesting

**Example Use Cases:**
- Allocate reserves based on company performance scores
- Deploy tranches based on milestone achievements
- Optimize allocation for risk-adjusted returns

### 4. Performance Forecasts (`performance_forecasts`)

Predictive models for fund and portfolio performance.

**Key Features:**
- Multiple forecast types: fund-level, portfolio-level, company-level
- Time series projections with confidence intervals
- Multiple methodologies: Monte Carlo, machine learning, expert judgment
- Accuracy tracking and model drift detection
- Integration with variance tracking baselines

**Example Use Cases:**
- Project IRR and multiple progression over 10 years
- Forecast NAV evolution and DPI realization
- Track forecast accuracy against actual results

### 5. Scenario Comparisons (`scenario_comparisons`)

Comparative analysis of different scenarios and strategies.

**Key Features:**
- Compare multiple scenarios across key metrics
- Statistical significance testing
- Pareto frontier and trade-off analysis
- Decision support and recommendations
- Visualization configurations

**Example Use Cases:**
- Compare base case vs optimistic scenarios
- Analyze risk-return trade-offs
- Generate recommendation reports

### 6. Monte Carlo Simulations (`monte_carlo_simulations`)

Detailed simulation results for risk analysis.

**Key Features:**
- Configurable number of simulation runs
- Input distributions and correlation matrices
- Risk metrics: VaR, CVaR, downside risk
- Performance attribution and sensitivity analysis
- Result storage and validation

**Example Use Cases:**
- Run 10,000 simulations of portfolio outcomes
- Calculate Value at Risk at 95% confidence
- Analyze factor contributions to returns
