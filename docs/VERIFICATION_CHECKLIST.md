# Post-Merge Verification Checklist

This checklist ensures circuit breaker implementation is properly deployed and functioning before proceeding with rollout phases.

## Phase 1: Shadow Mode Verification

### ✅ Code Deployment
- [ ] All circuit breaker PRs merged successfully
- [ ] Application builds and starts without errors
- [ ] No new TypeScript errors or linting issues
- [ ] All existing tests pass

### ✅ Environment Configuration
- [ ] `.env` file contains all CB_* variables (copy from `.env.example`)
- [ ] All circuit breakers disabled (`CB_*_ENABLED=false`)
- [ ] Environment variables loaded correctly (check startup logs)
- [ ] Configuration validation passes (no schema errors)

### ✅ API Endpoints
- [ ] `/metrics` endpoint accessible (`GET http://localhost:5000/metrics`)
- [ ] `/metrics/health` endpoint returns health status
- [ ] `/admin/circuit-breakers/state` returns breaker states
- [ ] `/readinessz` includes circuit breaker health check

### ✅ Metrics Collection
```bash
# Verify Prometheus metrics format
curl http://localhost:5000/metrics | grep updog_circuit_breaker

# Expected output should include:
# updog_circuit_breaker_state{breaker_name="cache",state="CLOSED"} 0
# updog_circuit_breaker_requests_total{breaker_name="cache",result="total"} 0
```

- [ ] Circuit breaker metrics present in `/metrics` output
- [ ] Metrics follow Prometheus format
- [ ] All breaker names appear (cache, http, db)
- [ ] State metrics show correct values (0=CLOSED, 1=HALF_OPEN, 2=OPEN)

### ✅ Logging & Observability
- [ ] Circuit breaker decision logs appear in application logs
- [ ] Log format includes breaker name, state, and timing
- [ ] No error logs from circuit breaker initialization
- [ ] Structured JSON logging working correctly

### ✅ Performance Baseline
```bash
# Run performance tests to establish baseline
npm run test:perf

# Or manual load test
k6 run tests/performance/baseline.js
```

- [ ] Application performance unchanged (p95 < 400ms maintained)
- [ ] No memory leaks or resource consumption increases
- [ ] Response times consistent with previous deployment
- [ ] Error rates remain at baseline levels

---

## Phase 2: Cache Canary Verification

### ✅ Configuration Update
- [ ] `CB_CACHE_ENABLED=true` applied
- [ ] Conservative thresholds configured (failure_threshold=10)
- [ ] Application restarted with new configuration
- [ ] No configuration validation errors

### ✅ Cache Circuit Breaker
```bash
# Verify cache breaker is active
curl http://localhost:5000/admin/circuit-breakers/state | jq '.states.cache'

# Should show:
# {
#   "state": "CLOSED",
#   "enabled": true,
#   "stats": {...}
# }
```

- [ ] Cache circuit breaker state shows "CLOSED" and "enabled": true
- [ ] Cache operations going through circuit breaker
- [ ] Memory fallback working during Redis unavailability
- [ ] Cache hits/misses logged correctly

### ✅ Failure Scenarios
```bash
# Test Redis failure simulation
docker-compose stop redis
# Verify app continues working with memory cache

# Test Redis recovery
docker-compose start redis
# Verify circuit breaker closes and Redis reconnects
```

- [ ] Redis outage triggers memory fallback (not circuit breaker trip)
- [ ] Application remains functional during Redis outage
- [ ] Circuit breaker closes when Redis recovers
- [ ] No user-facing errors during failover

### ✅ Monitoring Validation

## Phase 3: HTTP Services Verification

### ✅ Configuration Update
- [ ] `CB_HTTP_ENABLED=true` applied
- [ ] HTTP circuit breakers initialized for target APIs
- [ ] Conservative thresholds set (failure_threshold=5)
- [ ] Application restarted successfully

### ✅ HTTP Circuit Breakers
```bash
# Check HTTP breakers status
curl http://localhost:5000/admin/circuit-breakers/state | jq '.states | to_entries[] | select(.key | contains("http"))'
```

- [ ] HTTP circuit breakers show "CLOSED" state
- [ ] External API calls routed through circuit breakers
- [ ] Stale data fallbacks configured and working
- [ ] Timeout handling working correctly

### ✅ External API Protection
```bash
# Test external API failure simulation
# (Temporarily point API config to invalid endpoint)
```

- [ ] API failures trigger circuit breaker (after threshold)
- [ ] Stale data served when circuit breaker OPEN
- [ ] No cascading failures to other services
- [ ] Circuit breaker recovers when API restored

### ✅ Partner API Integration
- [ ] Market data APIs protected by circuit breakers
- [ ] Analytics service calls wrapped with breakers
- [ ] Non-critical data services have fallback strategies
- [ ] Critical authentication paths excluded from circuit breakers

## Phase 4: Database Protection (High Risk)

### ⚠️ Prerequisites Verification
- [ ] **All previous phases stable for 1+ week**
- [ ] Team trained on database circuit breaker behavior
- [ ] Robust caching strategies in place
- [ ] Read/write separation properly configured

### ✅ Read-Only Protection
- [ ] `CB_DB_ENABLED=true` applied
- [ ] **Only** read operations protected (analytics, reports)
- [ ] Write operations explicitly excluded
- [ ] Authentication/authorization queries excluded

### ✅ Database Failover
```bash
# Test read replica failure (staging only!)
# Simulate database connection issues
```

- [ ] Read failures trigger circuit breaker appropriately
- [ ] Cache fallbacks working for dashboard data
- [ ] Report generation gracefully degrades
- [ ] No impact on critical write operations

### ❌ **Critical Exclusions Verified**
