  - [ ] Uptime > 99.9%
  - [ ] Error rate < 1%
  - [ ] p99 latency < 5x p50
- [ ] Web Vitals stable
- [ ] No security alerts
- [ ] User feedback positive
- [ ] Support tickets baseline

### First Week
- [ ] BMAD report shows positive ROI
- [ ] Feature adoption tracking
- [ ] Performance trends stable
- [ ] Cost within budget
- [ ] Security scan clean

## Rollback Procedures

### Automatic Rollback Triggers
System automatically rolls back if:
- Error rate > 1% for 5 minutes
- p99 latency > 5x baseline for 10 minutes
- Memory usage > 90% sustained
- Database connections exhausted
- Canary health check fails

### Manual Rollback Steps
1. **Immediate Actions**
   ```bash
   # Stop traffic to new version
   npm run canary:halt
   
   # Revert deployment
   npm run deploy:rollback
   
   # Clear caches
   npm run cache:clear
   ```

2. **Database Rollback** (if migrations were run)
   ```bash
   # Stop write traffic
   npm run maintenance:on
   
   # Run rollback migrations
   npm run db:rollback --to=<previous_version>
   
   # Verify data integrity
   npm run db:verify
   
   # Resume traffic
   npm run maintenance:off
   ```

3. **Communication**
   - [ ] Update status page
   - [ ] Notify stakeholders via Slack
   - [ ] Send customer communication if impact > 15 minutes
   - [ ] Schedule post-mortem within 48 hours

## Emergency Contacts
