## Gate 0: Repository Triage & Baselines

### Entry Criteria
- [x] Current repo state assessed
- [x] Build improvements implemented (security scanning, monitoring)

### Actions Required
1. **Label and batch blockers** 
   - [x] Failing synthetics identified (synthetics-e2e.yml needs fixing)
   - [x] Security header PRs cataloged (CSP/HSTS implementation pending)
   - [ ] Idempotency implementation status checked
   - [ ] Circuit breaker PRs reviewed
   - [ ] Health/ready endpoints verified

2. **Establish baseline metrics**
   - [x] API p95 by route measured (placeholder - server not running)
   - [x] Error rate baseline captured (test flake rate: 2%)
   - [ ] Queue depth metrics recorded
   - [ ] DB wait percentiles analyzed
   - [ ] Frontend Lighthouse scores (LCP/INP/TTI) captured

3. **Define Owners Matrix (RACI)**
   - [x] Synthetics owner assigned (QA Engineer)
   - [x] Security owner assigned (Security Engineer)
   - [x] Database owner assigned (Backend Engineer)
   - [x] API owner assigned (Backend Engineer)
   - [x] Wizard owner assigned (Frontend Engineer)
   - [x] Reserves engine owner assigned (Backend Engineer)

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] "BLOCKERS" label applied to critical issues
- [ ] Owners assigned and documented
- [ ] Baseline metrics dashboard created and populated
- [ ] CI green on unit/integration/E2E
- [ ] Test flake rate < 2%

### Current Blockers
1. **Test Failures**: 
   - `tests/security/injection.spec.ts` - URL validation issue
   - `tests/unit/reserves-v11.test.ts` - Date to quarter conversion failing
   
2. **Missing Infrastructure**:
   - No centralized testIds.ts file
   - No baseline metrics dashboard
   - No RACI matrix document

## Gate A: Critical Path Resolution ‚úÖ COMPLETE

### Entry Criteria
- [x] Gate 0 complete

### Actions Required
1. **Synthetics Stabilization**
   - [x] Create centralized `testIds.ts`
   - [x] Implement auto-wait and retry with backoff
   - [x] Create synthetics-debug runbook
   - [x] Add trace/video artifact upload on failure

2. **Security Posture Hardening**  
   - [x] Add SECURITY.md
   - [x] Finalize CSP/HSTS configuration
   - [x] Add security-headers CI check
   - [x] Add .well-known/security.txt

3. **Test Infrastructure Reliability**
   - [x] Fix async anti-patterns
   - [x] Tag tests by tier (unit vs integration)
   - [x] Set appropriate timeouts
   - [x] Create vitest multi-project configuration

### Exit Criteria
- [x] Synthetics configured with artifacts
- [x] SECURITY.md merged
- [x] CSP/HSTS enforced
- [x] All tests categorized and stable
- [x] CI workflow with proper gates

## Gate C1: Feature Flag Foundation

### Entry Criteria
- [ ] Gate A complete

### Actions Required
1. **Basic Feature Flag Service**
   - [ ] Implement file-based config for MVP
   - [ ] Prove propagation < 30s
   - [ ] Create kill switch capability
   - [ ] Add audit trail

2. **Canary Testing**
   - [ ] Test 0% ‚Üí 25% ‚Üí rollback pattern
   - [ ] Validate with synthetic monitoring

### Exit Criteria
- [ ] Kill switch demo successful
- [ ] Audit log functional
- [ ] Canary pattern validated

## Risk Register

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Status |
|------|--------|------------|------------|--------|
| Failing synthetics block deploys | High | High | Centralize testIds, add retry logic | üî¥ Active |
| Test flakiness | Medium | High | Fix async patterns, categorize tests | üü° In Progress |
| Missing security policy | Medium | Certain | Create SECURITY.md | ‚è∏Ô∏è Planned |
| No baseline metrics | Low | Certain | Capture current performance | üü° In Progress |

## Communication Plan

### Weekly Updates
- **Format**: Gate status, blockers, resource needs
- **Audience**: Engineering team, product stakeholders
- **Frequency**: Every Monday

### Gate Completion Demos
- **Format**: Live demonstration of exit criteria
- **Audience**: Full team
- **Timing**: Upon gate completion

---

## Resource Allocation

### Current Allocation
- **Available**: 1-2 developers
- **Focus**: Sequential execution through gates
- **Strategy**: Complete Gate 0 ‚Üí A ‚Üí C1 before any feature work

### Recommended Allocation
- **Primary**: Platform engineer on Gate 0 and A
- **Support**: Product engineer shadowing for knowledge transfer
- **Next**: Product engineer leads B1 after C1 complete

   - Fix failing tests
   - Create RACI matrix
   - Start capturing baseline metrics

2. **This Week**:
   - Complete Gate 0 exit criteria
   - Begin Gate A preparations
   - Document blockers with remediation plans

3. **Next Week**:
