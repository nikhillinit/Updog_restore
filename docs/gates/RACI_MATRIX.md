# RACI Matrix - Updog_restore Development Strategy

## Legend
- **R** = Responsible (does the work)
- **A** = Accountable (decision maker, one per item)
- **C** = Consulted (provides input)
- **I** = Informed (kept in the loop)

| **Performance Budget Override** | Platform Lead | Product Lead, Engineering Manager | All Teams |
| **Resource Reallocation** | Engineering Manager | Tech Leads, Product | All Teams |

## Communication Responsibilities

| Communication Type | Owner | Frequency | Audience |
|-------------------|-------|-----------|----------|
| **Gate Status Update** | Platform Lead | Weekly | All Stakeholders |
| **Blocker Escalation** | Tech Leads | As Needed | Engineering Manager |
| **Security Incidents** | Security Lead | Immediate | Platform Lead, Product |
| **Performance Regression** | DevOps Lead | Daily | Platform, Backend |
| **Release Notes** | Product Manager | Per Release | All Stakeholders |
| **Post-Mortem Reports** | Incident Owner | Within 48hrs | All Teams |

## Escalation Path

1. **Technical Issues**: Developer → Tech Lead → Platform Lead → Engineering Manager
2. **Security Issues**: Anyone → Security Lead → Platform Lead → CTO
3. **Product Issues**: Anyone → Product Manager → Product Lead → Product VP
4. **Resource Issues**: Tech Lead → Engineering Manager → VP Engineering

## Role Assumptions

For execution with current resources:
- **1 Developer Mode**: Developer assumes all R responsibilities, Platform Lead is A for all
- **2 Developer Mode**: Split R between Platform and Product focus areas
- **3+ Developer Mode**: Distribute R per matrix, maintain single A per component

## Review Schedule

- **Weekly**: Activity progress and blockers
- **Per Gate**: Role effectiveness and adjustments needed
- **Monthly**: Overall RACI matrix optimization
