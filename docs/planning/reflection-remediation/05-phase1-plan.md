# Phase 1: Immediate Stabilization - Detailed Plan

## Overview
- Original Estimate: 2.5 hours
- Revised Estimate: ~1 hour (Step 1.1 complete)
- Priority: CRITICAL
- Blocking: Phase 2 cannot start until Phase 1 completes

## Step 1.1: Consolidate Reflection Systems [COMPLETE]

### Status: COMPLETE
- **Completed**: 2026-01-18T22:15:37Z
- **PR**: #442
- **Validation**: Codex confirmed all 6 checks passed

### What Was Done
1. Created REFL-018 from tools/reflection/REFL-001 (Reserve Engine Null Safety)
2. Deleted duplicate REFL-002 (same as REFL-013)
3. Removed tools/reflection/ directory via git rm
4. Updated vitest.config.ts to remove tools/reflection/tests include
5. Updated REFL-016 test to remove tools/reflection path reference
6. Rebuilt SKILLS_INDEX.md (now shows 18 reflections)

### Artifacts
- docs/skills/REFL-018-reserve-engine-null-safety.md
- tests/regressions/REFL-018.test.ts
- docs/plans/reflection-consolidation-plan.md

## Step 1.2: Fix CWD Dependency Bug [NOT STARTED]

### Original Plan
- Effort: 30 minutes
- Action: Add find_repo_root() to scripts/manage_skills.py

### Current Understanding
- scripts/manage_skills.py uses relative paths
- Fails when run from subdirectory
- Need to audit current implementation

### Pre-execution Checklist
- [ ] Read current scripts/manage_skills.py implementation
- [ ] Identify all path operations
- [ ] Search for existing find_repo_root patterns in codebase
- [ ] Design solution

### Implementation Plan
[PENDING - requires Codex consultation]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Script works from any subdirectory
- [ ] Script works from repo root (no regression)
- [ ] All existing tests pass
- [ ] New test covers CWD edge case

### Risks
- RISK-003: Script may have multiple CWD dependencies

## Step 1.3: Enhance /advise Command [NOT STARTED]

### Original Plan
- Effort: 30 minutes
- Action: Add "Related Documentation" section to /advise output

### Current Understanding
- Need to locate /advise implementation
- Unknown current behavior

### Pre-execution Checklist
- [ ] Grep for /advise implementation
- [ ] Understand current output format
- [ ] Design Related Documentation section
- [ ] Identify link sources

### Implementation Plan
[PENDING - requires discovery]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] /advise output includes Related Documentation section
- [ ] Links are valid and relevant
- [ ] No regression in existing functionality

---

## Step 1.4: Cross-links in SKILLS_INDEX.md [NOT STARTED]

### Original Plan
- Effort: 15 minutes
- Action: Add footer with navigation links

### Current Understanding
- SKILLS_INDEX.md is auto-generated by manage_skills.py
- Need to modify rebuild_index() function

### Pre-execution Checklist
- [ ] Review current SKILLS_INDEX.md structure
- [ ] Review rebuild_index() in manage_skills.py
- [ ] Design footer content

### Implementation Plan
[PENDING - straightforward after reviewing code]

### Success Criteria
- [ ] SKILLS_INDEX.md has navigation footer
- [ ] Footer includes links to CAPABILITIES.md, DECISIONS.md, etc.
- [ ] manage_skills.py rebuild generates footer correctly
