1. **Calculate Fully Diluted Shares**
   Add up all existing outstanding shares plus all shares reserved in your option pool.

   > Fully Diluted Shares = Total Current Shares + Option Pool Shares

2. **Determine Current Ownership Percentage**
   For each stakeholder, divide their individual share count by the Fully Diluted Shares.

   > Ownership % (today) = Sharesᵢ ÷ Fully Diluted Shares

3. **Compute Price per Share for the Next Round**
   Take your pre-money valuation, add any option-pool top-up amount, and divide by the total number of shares that will be outstanding just before closing (existing fully diluted shares plus any new option shares).

   > Price per Share = (Pre-Money Valuation + Option Pool Increase)
   >                ÷ (Fully Diluted Shares + New Option Shares)

4. **Calculate New Investor Shares**
   Divide the total new capital you’re raising by the Price per Share.

   > New Investor Shares = Round Size ÷ Price per Share

5. **Find Post-Money Valuation**
   Simply add the new capital raised to the pre-money valuation.

   > Post-Money Valuation = Pre-Money Valuation + Round Size

6. **Determine the Conversion Price for SAFEs/Notes**

   * **Cap-Based Price**: Divide the valuation cap by the implied pre-round share count (pre-money valuation ÷ fully diluted shares).
   * **Discount-Based Price**: Multiply the new round Price per Share by (1 − Discount %).
     Then take the lower of those two prices.

   > Conversion Price = min(Cap-Based Price, Discount-Based Price)

7. **Convert Each SAFE/Note into Shares**
   For each instrument, divide its invested principal by the Conversion Price.

   > SAFE/Note Shares = Principal ÷ Conversion Price

8. **Compute the New Total Share Count After the Round**
   Add together the original Fully Diluted Shares, the New Investor Shares, and all SAFE/Note Shares.

   > New Total Shares = Fully Diluted Shares + New Investor Shares + Σ SAFE/Note Shares

9. **Recalculate Ownership Percentages Post-Round**
   For every stakeholder (founders, employees, investors, converted note holders), divide their final share count by the New Total Shares.

   > Ownership % (post-round) = Sharesᵢ ÷ New Total Shares
