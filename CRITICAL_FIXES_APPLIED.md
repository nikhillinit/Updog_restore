# Critical Fixes Applied

## Overview
Based on expert review, we've addressed critical operational and security issues in the parallel implementation approach.

## ‚úÖ Completed Fixes

### 1. Migration Strategy (FIXED)
**Issue**: Single giant migration creates rollback complexity  
**Solution**: Split into 4 independent, reversible migrations
- `0002_concurrency_safety.sql` - Row versioning, idempotency, advisory locks
- `0003_multi_tenancy.sql` - Organizations, partners, RLS, feature flags  
- `0004_versioning_encryption.sql` - Calc versions, WASM registry, PII encryption
- `0005_audit_pipeline.sql` - Comprehensive audit with outbox pattern

**Benefit**: Each step can be rolled back independently without affecting others

### 2. Partner Validation (FIXED)
**Issue**: Extracting partner ID from email is fragile  
**Solution**: Created proper `partners` table with canonical `partner_id`
```typescript
// Before: partnerId: s.partnerEmail.split('@')[0]
// After: partnerId from JOIN with partners table
```

### 3. Rate Limiting (FIXED)
**Issue**: In-memory rate limiter won't work across multiple instances  
**Solution**: Redis-backed rate limiter with sliding window algorithm
- Distributed rate limiting across all server instances
- Fallback to in-memory for development
- Proper retry-after headers for clients

### 4. Security Context (FIXED)
**Issue**: Trusting X-User-Id headers from client is dangerous  
**Solution**: Derive all context from verified JWT claims only
```typescript
// New secure approach:
const context = extractUserContext(req); // JWT only
// Explicitly reject any X-User-Id headers
```

### 5. Contract Documentation (FIXED)
**Issue**: Schema drift risk during parallel development  
**Solution**: Locked contract document at `/docs/contracts/parallel-foundation.md`
- Immutable table schemas
- API contracts  
- Integration points
- Change requires team consensus

### 6. Migration System (STANDARDIZED)
**Decision**: Raw SQL with explicit UP/DOWN sections
- Consistent approach across all migrations
- Each migration is independently reversible
- Clear rollback procedures documented

## üîí Security Improvements

### JWT-Only Authentication
- User context derived exclusively from verified JWT claims
- Client headers (`X-User-Id`, etc.) are explicitly ignored and logged as suspicious
- RLS policies use JWT-derived context only

### Transaction-Scoped Advisory Locks
```sql
BEGIN;
SELECT pg_try_advisory_xact_lock(...);
-- Work
COMMIT; -- Auto-released
```
No manual cleanup required, prevents orphaned locks

### Canonical JSON Hashing
- Deep key sorting for true determinism
- Consistent hashing across all nodes
- Prevents false cache misses

## üìä Operational Improvements

### Proper RLS Context Setting
```typescript
await db.transaction(async (tx) => {
  await setDatabaseContext(tx, context);
  // All queries respect context
});
```

### Hierarchical Flag Resolution
- Proper precedence: user > fund > org > global
- Cache headers prevent cross-user pollution
- ETag support for efficient polling

### Comprehensive Audit Pipeline
- DB-first approach (works even if streaming is down)
- Transactional outbox for guaranteed delivery
- ULID message IDs for deduplication

## üöÄ Performance Enhancements

### Redis-Backed Rate Limiting
- O(log N) operations with sorted sets
- Automatic expiry of old entries
- Monitoring endpoints for usage tracking

### Advisory Lock Logging
- Track lock contention patterns
- Identify bottlenecks
- Optimize based on real usage

## üìù Documentation

### Contract Enforcement
- `/docs/contracts/parallel-foundation.md` locks all interfaces
- Changes require explicit team agreement
- Version tracking for contract evolution

### Migration Documentation
- Each migration has clear UP/DOWN sections
- Rollback procedures tested and documented
- Dependencies explicitly stated

## Next Steps

Teams can now proceed with parallel implementation with confidence:
1. Run migrations in order: 0002 ‚Üí 0003 ‚Üí 0004 ‚Üí 0005
2. Each team implements their assigned interface
3. Integration tests verify RLS and security
4. Acceptance tests ensure requirements met

## Risk Mitigation

- **Rollback Ready**: Each migration independently reversible
- **Security First**: JWT-only context, no header trust
- **Distributed Safe**: Redis rate limiting works across instances
- **Audit Complete**: Every action logged with actor and context
- **Contract Locked**: No schema drift during parallel work

The foundation is now production-ready and teams can work independently without integration risks.
