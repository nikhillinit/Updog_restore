I'll help you verify that everything works by running the development server and build process. Let me start by running the dev server to check for any console errors. Let me check the terminal output to see if the dev server started successfully: Great! The development server has started successfully. I can see that:
- Vite is running on `http://localhost:5173/`
- Both client and API servers are running concurrently
- No immediate console errors are visible

Let me open the application in the browser to verify it loads properly: Now let me check for any additional output or errors that might have appeared: I can see that the development server encountered some issues with external services (Redis on port 6379 and NATS on port 4222), but the client side started successfully. The API server failed due to missing external dependencies. Let me try running the build process to see if it works without these runtime dependencies:

Don't worry. We are working on that later. Let's go ahead and commit:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Implement comprehensive array-safety architecture

- Created centralized array-safety utility with TypeScript generics
- Added 47 comprehensive tests (all passing)
- Implemented ESLint rule to prevent unsafe patterns
- Fixed existing unsafe forEach patterns via migration script
- Added team adoption guide and documentation
- Enhanced fund model and cohort engine to use safe utilities

This eliminates null/undefined array errors at the architectural level."
