## Issue Resolved ✅

The quarantine test failure from **2025-09-30** has been resolved.

### Root Cause
The workflow failed during the `npm ci` step because the package.json contained an old husky prepare script that was incompatible with Husky v9:

```
TypeError: require(...).install is not a function
```

### Resolution
The package.json has been updated with the correct pattern for Husky v9:

**Previous (broken):**
```json
"prepare": "node -e \"try { require('husky').install() } catch (e) { if (e.code !== 'MODULE_NOT_FOUND') throw e }\""
```

**Current (working):**
```json
"prepare": "husky || true"
```

### Verification
✅ `npm ci` completes successfully  
✅ Quarantine tests can execute  
✅ No other old husky patterns found  
✅ Workflow verified to work end-to-end

### Next Steps
- The next scheduled nightly run (tomorrow at 03:23 UTC) should complete successfully
- Any test failures in the quarantine suite are expected - these tests are quarantined due to flakiness
- This issue can be closed
