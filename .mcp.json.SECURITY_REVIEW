# MCP Server Security Review

## ⚠️ SECURITY CONCERNS - .mcp.json

### Issue
The `.mcp.json` configuration auto-registers the `multi-ai-collab` MCP server from:
```
%AppData%\Claude\Claude Extensions\multi-ai-collab
```

### Risk Assessment: **HIGH**

This creates a **supply chain security vulnerability** because:

1. **Code Outside Repository**: The server code lives outside this repo and cannot be audited here
2. **Auto-Registration**: Code runs automatically without explicit verification
3. **Trust-on-First-Use (TOFU)**: No cryptographic verification of server identity or integrity
4. **Privilege Escalation**: MCP servers run with user permissions and can execute arbitrary commands

### Attack Vectors

1. **Malicious Server**: Attacker tricks user into installing malicious MCP server
2. **Compromised Update**: Legitimate server's update mechanism is compromised
3. **Vulnerable Code**: Server contains exploitable vulnerabilities

### Mitigation Strategy

#### Immediate Actions
1. ✅ Disabled `enableAllProjectMcpServers` in `.claude/settings.local.json`
2. ✅ Created this security review document
3. **TODO**: Audit the multi-ai-collab server code at the source location
4. **TODO**: Verify provenance (official source, developer identity, code signing)

#### Before Re-enabling
- [ ] Review server source code for security issues
- [ ] Verify server is from trusted source
- [ ] Check for active maintenance and security updates
- [ ] Document server capabilities and permissions required
- [ ] Test in isolated environment first

#### Long-term Recommendations
1. **Code Signing**: Only allow digitally signed MCP servers
2. **Explicit Approval**: Require user consent before any MCP server loads
3. **Sandboxing**: Run MCP servers in restricted environments
4. **Integrity Checks**: Verify SHA-256 hashes of server binaries
5. **Audit Trail**: Log all MCP server registrations and tool calls

### Server Vetting Checklist

Before enabling any MCP server:

- [ ] **Source Code Available**: Can you review the code?
- [ ] **Trusted Developer**: Is it from a known, reputable source?
- [ ] **Active Maintenance**: Recent commits, security updates?
- [ ] **Dependency Scan**: No known CVEs in dependencies?
- [ ] **Minimal Permissions**: Only requests necessary capabilities?
- [ ] **Digital Signature**: Cryptographically signed by developer?
- [ ] **Community Vetted**: Used and reviewed by others?

### Current Status

**multi-ai-collab server**: ⏸️ DISABLED PENDING REVIEW

**Action Required**: Manual security audit before re-enabling
