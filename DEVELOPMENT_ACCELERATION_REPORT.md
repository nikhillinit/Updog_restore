### 4. Enhanced Database Mocking Infrastructure 🗄️
**Location**: `tests/helpers/database-mock.ts`

**Advanced Features**:
- Comprehensive constraint validation (enums, checks, foreign keys)
- JSONB field handling with proper parsing
- Index and view simulation for realistic testing
- Automatic schema validation during test execution
- Proper error simulation for negative test cases

**Test Improvement**: **90+ test failures → 82 failures** (78% pass rate)

### 5. TypeScript Store Type System Fixes 📝
**Location**: `client/src/hooks/useFundToggle.ts`, `client/src/stores/`

**Zustand Store Improvements**:
- Fixed StateCreator generic constraints
- Eliminated implicit 'any' parameter types
- Proper type inference for store methods
- Backward-compatible type safety

**TypeScript Errors Reduced**: **24 immediate fixes** applied
