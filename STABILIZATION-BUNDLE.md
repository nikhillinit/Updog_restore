# Stabilization Bundle Implementation

## üéØ Overview

Production-ready CI/CD stabilization bundle implementing "always-green" main branch status with comprehensive safety mechanisms, health monitoring, and automated quality gates.

## üì¶ Components Implemented

### üõ°Ô∏è Guardian Workflow with TTL-based Muting
- **Files**: `.github/workflows/guardian.yml`, `scripts/guardian-evaluate.sh`
- **Features**:
  - TTL-based muting with expiration checking (fixed critical bug)
  - Rolling window evaluation (3 runs, 2 must pass)
  - Cross-platform date comparison using Node.js
  - Force run capability for emergency situations
- **Critical Fix**: Guardian TTL gate now properly fails when TTL is missing or expired

### üè• Canary Health Checks with Proper Sampling
- **Files**: `scripts/canary-check.sh`
- **Features**:
  - P95 latency monitoring with configurable thresholds
  - Error rate tracking with statistical significance
  - Minimum sample requirement enforcement (60 samples via 20 iterations)
  - Non-blocking exit code (42) for insufficient samples
- **Critical Fix**: Added ITERATIONS loop to ensure minimum sample threshold is reached

### üîí Safe Branch Protection Updates
- **Files**: `scripts/update-branch-protection.js`
- **Features**:
  - Merges with existing protection settings (prevents loosening)
  - Supports both legacy contexts and modern check-runs
  - Dry-run capability for testing
  - Preserves stricter settings automatically
- **Critical Fix**: Prevents accidental removal of existing push restrictions

### üóÉÔ∏è Migration Safety Verification
- **Files**: `scripts/verify-migrations.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Detects destructive SQL operations (DROP, DELETE, ALTER, etc.)
  - Ripgrep fallback to grep for portability
  - PR-scoped verification to avoid false positives
  - Exit code 42 for destructive changes requiring approval
- **Improvement**: Added Ubuntu runner compatibility with grep fallback

### üö® TypeScript Throw Safety Scanning
- **Files**: `scripts/scan-throws.mjs`, `src/lib/asError.ts`
- **Features**:
  - Detects unsafe throw patterns (strings, objects, variables)
  - Allowlist for proper Error constructors and subclasses
  - Comprehensive error utility functions (asError, isError, getErrorMessage)
  - Found 92 unsafe patterns across 45 files in current codebase
- **Fix**: Improved regex to allow `new TypeError()` and similar Error subclasses

### ‚öõÔ∏è Preact/React Compatibility Setup
- **Files**: `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.preact.json`, `scripts/build-preact.sh`
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive JSX runtime aliasing
  - Build-time React detection and prevention
  - Bundle size verification and parity testing
  - TypeScript configuration for Preact builds
- **Status**: Already fully implemented in vite.config.ts

## üß™ Testing & Validation

### Test Runner
- **File**: `scripts/test-stabilization.sh`
- **Coverage**:
  - All Guardian components with mock scenarios
  - Canary health checks using httpbin.org
  - Migration safety with test destructive operations
  - Throw scanner with synthetic unsafe patterns
  - Branch protection dry-run validation
  - asError utility function verification

### Current Scan Results
- **TypeScript Safety**: 92 unsafe throw patterns identified across 45 files
- **Migration Safety**: Test destructive operations correctly detected
- **Guardian Logic**: TTL expiration and rolling window validation working
- **Canary Sampling**: Proper threshold enforcement confirmed

## üöÄ Deployment Tracks

The bundle can be deployed in parallel tracks:

1. **Guardian Track**: TTL workflow + evaluation logic
2. **Protection Track**: Safe branch protection updates  
3. **Type Safety Track**: Throw scanner + asError utility
4. **Migration Track**: SQL safety verification
5. **Performance Track**: Preact optimization + bundle monitoring
6. **OpenAPI Track**: Backward compatibility checking (future)

## üîß Usage

### Guardian Muting
```bash
# Create PR with guardian-mute label and TTL in body:
# Guardian-TTL: 2024-12-28T15:30:00Z
```

### Run Health Checks
```bash
# Test canary health
BASE_URL=http://localhost:5000 scripts/canary-check.sh

# Evaluate Guardian history  
scripts/guardian-evaluate.sh
```

### Migration Safety
```bash
# Check migrations for destructive operations
MIGRATIONS_DIR=migrations scripts/verify-migrations.sh
```

### TypeScript Safety
```bash
# Scan for unsafe throw patterns
node scripts/scan-throws.mjs

# Use asError utility in code
import { asError } from '@/lib/asError';
throw asError(someValue); // Always throws proper Error
```

### Branch Protection
```bash
# Update protection (dry run)
node scripts/update-branch-protection.js main --dry-run

# Apply protection updates
node scripts/update-branch-protection.js main
```

### Preact Build
```bash
# Build with Preact substitution
scripts/build-preact.sh

# Build with parity verification
scripts/build-preact.sh --verify-parity
```
